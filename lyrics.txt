Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Yeah  
Too late  
I cant keep chasing em  
Im taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that Ive made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed  
But Ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
Im a take control of this relationship  
Command it and Im a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while Ive stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
Ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this Ill no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath  
You know what youve done no need to go in depth  
I told you youd be sorry if I fucking left  
Id laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free youve said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its  
  
  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
  
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Dont think Im loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Dont I give you enough of my time  
You dont think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why Im married to you still man I dont know  
But tonight Im serving you with papers  
Im divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you  
Feed em the same shit you made me eat  
Im moving on forget you oh  
Now Im special Oh I didnt feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
Im addicted  
To the pain the stress the drama  
Im drown in so I guess Im a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time Im a  
Aint changing my mind  
Im climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that Ill be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
You left me off your list  
  
Fuck you hiphop  
Im leaving you my life sentence is served bitch  
And its just  
  
  
  
Too late  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life

Theres no place to hideyoyo  
You scream someone save meyoyo  
But they dont pave no mind yo yo  
Good night  
Good bye  
  
Your walkin down a horror corridor  
Its almost four in the mornin  
And your in a nightmare  
Its horrible  
Right theres the coroner  
Waitin for you  
To turn the corner  
So he can corner ya  
Your a goner  
Hes on a ya  
Out the corner of his cornea  
He just saw you run  
All you want is to rest  
Cause you cant run anymore  
Your done  
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience  
While everybody  
Is watchin in the party applauding it  
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again  
Contemplating my next plot again  
Swallowin a colata pin  
While Im noddin  
In and out on the ottoman and  
If the Ramada Inn  
Holdin onto the pill bottle then  
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom  
And make sure I got all of it  
Wake up naked at Mcdonalds  
With  
Blood all over me  
Dead bodies  
Behind the counter  
Shit  
Guess I must of just blacked out again  
Not again  
  
  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
I said  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
  
Sitting nude in my living room  
Its almost noon  
I wonder whats on the tube  
Maybe theyll show some boobs  
Surfing every channel  
Until I find Hannah Montana  
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin  
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin  
Every candle on top of the fire place  
Mantalin  
Grab my flannel and my bandana then  
Kiss the naked manequin man again  
You can see him standin in my  
Front window  
If you look in  
Im just a hooligan  
Whos use to usin hallucinogens  
Causin illusions again  
Brain contusions again  
Cutting and bruising the skin  
Raise the scissors and pins  
Jesus when does it end  
Phases that I go through  
Dazed and not so confused  
Days that I dont know who  
Gave these molecules too  
Me  
What am I gone do  
Hey the prodigal son  
The diabolical one  
Very methodical  
When I slaughter dem  
  
  
  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
  
I duck and I slash slice and gash  
Last night was a blast  
I cant quite remember when I  
Had that much fun  
Off a half pint fifth of Jack  
My last Vic and a half  
A flashlight  
Up Kim Kardashians ass  
  
I remember the first time  
I dismembered the family member  
December I think it was  
I was having drinks with my cousin  
And I wrapped him  
In Christmas lights  
Pushed him into the stinkin tub  
Cut him up into pieces  
Then just when I went to drink his  
Blood  
I thought I outta drink his bath water  
That outta be fun  
Thats when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun  
The sight of blood excites me  
That might be an artery son  
Your blood coverin screams  
Just dont seem to bother me none  
Its three am  
And here I come  
So you should probably run  
A secret passage way around here  
Man theres got to be one  
Oh no theres probably none  
He can scream all that he wants  
Top of his lungs  
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him upup

Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless  
Patrolling corners  
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters  
Im meaner in action  
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer   
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments  
I grew up in the wild hood  
As a hazardous youth  
With a fucked up childhood  
That I used as an excuse  
And aint shit changed  
But kept the same mindstate  
Since the third time that I failed th grade  
You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it  
I dont promote violence I just encourage it  
I laugh at the sight of death  
As I fall down a cement flight of steps  
And land inside a bed of spider webs  
So throw caution to the wind  
You and a friend  
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again  
shit why not Blow your brain out  
Im blowing mine out  
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now  
  
Its only fair to warn  
I was born with a set of horns  
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord  
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board  
That smashed into your Honda Accord  
With a  door Ford  
But Im more toward droppin an accapella  
And choppin a fella  
To mozarella  
Worse than a hellacopta propella  
Got you locked in the cella  
With your skeleton showing  
Developing anorexia  
While Im standin next to ya  
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death  
With an iv in your veins  
Feeding you liquid darvicet  
Pumping you full of drugs  
Pull the plugs  
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
Who were picked up in an ambulance  
And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
And given  
A less than  percent chance  
Of living  
Have a possible placement  
Its a hospital patient  
Storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement  
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived  
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "IM STILL ALIVE"  
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth  
Better call the fire department  
Ive hired a arson  
To set fire to carpet  
And burn up your entire apartment  
Im a liar to start shit   
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick  
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit  
  
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg  
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the   
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula D  
fuck an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
Im blowin up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas  
Cross the bombas   
We blowin up your house killing your parents  
And coming back to get your foster mommas  
And Im as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets  
Im more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more cause I smoked crack   
Today yesterday and the day before sabbath  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Banvan full of ganja now come on ja

Doin the chacha and the cucaracha with a quadra  
Polegic boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."  
Lindsey to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya  
Whod a knew the pewd a do to me what its done  
Such sinasism when it isnt in my system.  
Bluntigmatism betta spliff up to my lips son  
So much on my hands I gotta give my kids a fistbump.  
Christopher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks  
"Mista help me"s what he said to me and then sunk.  
Women skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks  
In clumps the woman with cocoabutter skin once.  
  
  
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
Skin em up hem em sew em up in those kilts  
Up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts.  
Man you dont want to go up in those hills  
Up in those hills uppaup in those hills.  
You better beware stay clear of Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
  
Always you can see him lurkin in the hallways  
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.  
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place  
Hide em in the wall well how long will the drywall take  
Well fuck it then Ive got nothin but time Ill wait.  
Until it dries for the moment I guess youre all safe.  
After I sand it and buff it I guess that Ill paint  
My chainsaws outta gas my regular saw aint.  
Now here I come again damn stomach rumblin  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within.  
Someones in the back of my damn house rummagin  
Its a girl she looks pretty thin but I want her skin.  
Been on the hunt again when will it ever end  
Evelyn why you tryin to fight You will never win.  
Severin legs arms damn there goes another limb.  
Pull the lever then trap door death is evident.  
  
  
  
Now what ya know about Buffalo Bill  
Nothin so chill.  
Fuckin hoe ya better fuckin hold still.  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket dont spill.  
Cut em gut em n just get to stuffin those girls.

Blades baby when I cut ya dont squeal

I keep hearin voices like "Wouldnt ya like to go an get your butcher knife  
And push it right through her while ya put your shishkebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer Would ya do to her

"In a world of sindoer this is turnin into a  
Torment tournament of sorts Christmas ornaments you are."

Oh God Saddams got his own Laden  
With his own private plane his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges boom sound  
Oranges peach pears plums syringes  
Yeah here I come

Hip hop is in a state of  so

Must be a circus in town lets shut the shit down  
On these clowns can I get a witness  
Hell Yeah  
  
Quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When Im gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So skip to ya Lou while I do what I do best  
You aint even impressed no more you used to it  
Flows too wet nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
Theres no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin and you know what for  
The show must go on so Id like to welcome yall  
To Marshall and Andres carnival  
Come on Now

Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin a sweat  
People steppin over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats and be so breezy  
Jesus how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MCs dont see me  
Believe me BET and MTV  
Are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo sheezy  
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me  
Til we grow beards get weird and disappear into the mountains

So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isnt how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shitd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldnt quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no inbetween  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three then three  
Years later theyd go back and rerate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The Marshall Mathers was a classic  
The Eminem Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just aint passed yet  
A couple more years that shitll be illmatic  
And eight years later Im still at it  
Divorce remarried  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I got a letter from a fan that said  
Hes been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
Its been weighing on my mind heavy  
Cause I dont read every  
Letter I get but something told me to go ahead and open it but  
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you  
You didnt pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where Im at  
Ive already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got  
God on my side  
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it  
Just watchin it from an opposite standpoint  
Man boys got to look  
Nuts  
And thats the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold

And eat the fucking octa Moms pussy lips with some okra  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg Sizzle with Oprah  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa  
Getting home and play dick swords with the JonasBrothers  
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers Like no other

Wheres my snare  
I have no snare in my headphones  
There you go yeah yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against  
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep goin  
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin  
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evening  
Leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Aint you mama Im a make you look so ridiculous now  
  
 x  
I said Im sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I dont know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
Im a expose it Ill take you back to   
Before I ever had a multiplatinum sellin CD  
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her side  
Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailies sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but Im only human  
But Im man enough to face them today  
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause Id a killed them shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life Id like to welcome yall to The Eminem Show  
  
 x  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin yo mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin  
Goin through public housing systems victim of Munchhausens syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt  
Til I grew up now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it  
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma  
Well guess what your gettin older now and  
Its cold when your lonely and Nathans growin up so quick  
Hes gonna know that your phony  
And Hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful  
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong  
Bitch do your song  
Keep tellin yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get  
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be

Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
Eminem     
This was a beat with no words at first its a blank painting  
Exercising the mind its brain strength training  
Starts off something like shadys an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady thats a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name baby  
Wife beaters and white tshirts  
Hanes mainly its a long shot but is it possible  
Theres a lane maybe  
If not hes gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his fcking name feinting  
Shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore hes ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And hes about to be raped by this game anally.  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
Eminem     
Youre operating on all cylinders  
Syllables spit like dillingers  
Spilling your guts  
People are feeling your mic skills  
But these haters are ice grillin ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya die for ya  
But you cant decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasnt like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it  
Fck no the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship  
With another girl this World is a fcking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed take another hit  
Sniff til I fcking url  
Tell em all to fcking sit and spin til they fcking twirl  
Middle finger up again  
Relapsing back in this game oh well fck it then  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted
