I dont drink brass monkey like to be funky
Nickname EazyE your  ball junkie
Bass drum kickin to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick boy I dont quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo mean hombre
Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers I have to pause
 ounce in my lap and its freezing my balls
 a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the  in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title Im holding
EazyEs fucked up and got the  ball rolling
 
Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw
Turned down south to dish the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cos a mexican almost wrecked my shit.
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store.
Nigga on till cos I was drunk
See ya sissy as punk had to go in my trunk.
Reached inside cos its like that
Came back out with a silver Gat.
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was.
 
Put up the jam and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge.
Sucker on me cos the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the  ball rollin
Old Es  cos thats my plan.
Take it in a bottle  quart or can.
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a  too.
Stepped at a party I was drunk as hell
 bitches already said "Eric yo breath smells"
ounce in hand thats what I got
"Yo man you see Eazy hurlin in the parkin lot"
Stepped on yo foot cold dissed yo ho
Asked her to dance and she said "Hell no"
Called her a bitch cos thats the rule
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool.
Tell me homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up.
I start drivin the dog and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got num dot co.
"Make you look sick ya snottynose prick
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick."
Punk got dropped cos the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the ball rollin.
 
Pass the broom motherfucker while I tear shit up
And yall listen up close to rollcall.
EazyEs in the place I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce.
Dre makes the beat so goddamn funky
Do the  fuck the brass monkey.
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA.
Crazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect.
Make a toast pumpy pump to the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the ball rollin.

Hey yo man remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy Yo
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rolled Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Down on Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded  gauge
 sucker dead LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my  Impala
They greet me with a  and I start drinkin
And from the ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a rightcross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy hell do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
 days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
"Disruption of the court" said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "fire" then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a submachine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit

Song Pass Me Da Green
Typed by burning@aol.com
This is a ghetto public announcement weed smokers
Roll your blunts tight
And light your joints
Inhaleslowly exhale
And thats how you get high.
clip from Friday
I know you dont smoke weed I know this
But Im gonna get you high today
Cause its Friday you aint got no job and you aint got shit to do
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat *}
Inhale.exhale Eyes selling red got my dank from the Bahamas
Went to see my girl smoke some green with her mama
Jumped in my Cutlass on the way to the liquor store
Picked up some blunts got ten on the 
Fix these palm trees wit some green leaves
Got a niggas head spinning like the seven seas
Puff puff pass nigga thats what Simon say
Fools that hog the green or da weed gonna get carried away
Fingernails burnt lookin like a tweeker
Ears steadily poppin but not from the speakers
Green got me hungry fiendin for them munchies
cause real smokers dont blow no fuckin green on empty stomachs
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat *}
Green trees pack wood make cabbage
I like to get high but it aint a bad habit
Speed up with that weed smoke comin out my llac
Got a hottie in the front and one in the back
Blowin shotguns to me and my homie
I feel like this weed make a young nigga horny
I stopped the fuckin lac at Holiday Inn
I aint even trippin told the girls to come in
Laid her down steady cause she know Im ready
Choppin up weed like motherfuckin spaghetti
Hoes down south must know voodoo
cause every time I hit the weed Im lookin for Isuzus
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat *}
Yall high yet
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat *}
Damn nigga yall chokin get the fuck out of here nigga
Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy

Pass me da green I need some weed with my Hennessy {*repeat *}

Put ya skinny little ass in my face and Ill slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before i tap it
My left hands on your ass my right hands on your head
cause bitches get the nut. and niggas get the lead

Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
Thats why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
use a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script dont slip in the ninefo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and Im my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe H.P. and Sunnydale
Theres a playaz club every one you dwell
Lakeview P.H. and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
press play on the remote at the playaz club
chorus
more champagne Mr. Forte
From day one I had to get my money right
Me Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few Gs for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words get now Tays out rappable
Dont need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase
Cuz the chase is on because it dont stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldnt sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin Tay Im on the smooth tip
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club
chorus
You cant resist it but dont get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the numbers not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about
I stack paper and kick it with the O.Gs
Some got a ninetofive some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I aint got time you aint nuthin but a playa hater
Id rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
Its just an everyday thang at the playaz club
chorus
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

But tell me whos a witness to ya fuckin work
See ya never had no business so save the drama jerk

See I did dirt but put in work and many niggas can vouch that
So since Ive got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you I gotta hate ya
Cause Im just tired of so many niggas
Claiming that they come from projects
Knowin you aint seen no parts of the streets G
Think ya started trying to bang a rap

Little fag try to sag but ya floodin at the same time
And ya set dont accept ya Scared to kick it with your homies

From wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics
And now ya think your bigger but to me you aint nothin

Hey yo man remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfuckers said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit yeah the stupid shit
Hey yo Eazy Yo
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rolled Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Down on Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded  gauge
 sucker dead LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my  Impala
They greet me with a  and I start drinkin
And from the ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a rightcross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy hell do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
 days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
"Disruption of the court" said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "fire" then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a submachine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit

Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the niggas dome now hes sleeps
 shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep  I dumped on the lil skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about  blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops
Shit fuck em

YEAH
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa hate brought death
Around the block as I holler points bust though the punks back
Raising gang feel no pain as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill Im wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breath young hell razors
Im  odd  with the skill
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts led in that niggas flesh
Aint no hope every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
 
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his glock in the back of my neck
Im thinkin to myself what the fuck as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do
If I make a wrong move the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy Im bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
ed up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dirt to Daytons I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 
The black nigga killa
 
Which bitch made the statement
About the nigga bustin caps supportin all black Ben Davis
Im out the doe
My pagers blowin up I check my ghat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as Im livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the pause upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Aint no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So  with that L might be mando
Cause nigga Im killin for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa

Aiyo man you remember that shit eazy did a while back
Muthafuckaz said wasnt gonna work that crazy shit
Stupid shit man aiyo eazy
Why dont you come out from the piano
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Jus thought that I had to be in compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about ma friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the path throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed ma clip
Wit the mack  on the side of ma hip
Bailed outside and pointed ma weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on ma ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the alpine play play
Pumpin new shit by nwa
It was gangsta gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit and it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh el camino rollin kilo g
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that g.t.a.
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull ya card
Knowin nutin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy Cause I aint said shit
Yo man
"get the fuck out"
Scratches pump that beat
Muthafucka say what
Down on bs is the place to give me the pace
He said ma man j.d. is on freebase
The boy j.d. was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car tryin to steal the alpine
Chased him down the street to call a truce
The silly muthafucka pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded  guage
 sucker dead l.a. times front page
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull ya card
Knowin nutin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy Cause I aint said shit
"Yo leroy"
"Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue"
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where ma homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin dat dollar
I pulled up in ma  fo impala
They greet me wit a  and I start drinkin
And from the  ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get ma girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his oldass out
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull ya card
Knowin nutin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy Cause I aint said shit
"Who do u think you are Mr. big stuff"
"Rock this muthafucka like the hard  tha hard way"
Im rollin hard now under control
Then wrapped the  fo round a telephone pole
I looked at ma car and I said "oh brother"
Ill throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I seen the g ride
Now cat is drivin kilo on the side
As they busted a u they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green nova
Cat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked a pig in the head for rippin his guess
Now g is caught for doin the crime
th offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull ya card
Knowin nutin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
L.a. playa
Big drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
 days later in municipal court
Kilo g on trial cold cut a fart
Obstruction of the court said the judge
On a six year sentence ma man didnt budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo g looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzie
The bitch came in with a submachine uzi
Police shot the bitch but they didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull ya card
Knowin nutin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy Cause I aint said shit
"Yeah I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past muthafucka
"Get busy ya ya ya yall"

My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin out profanity so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy
That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So thats how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental thats recorded
Step on stage and Im suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a screen from the girls in the back
Takin a bow cause I got style
Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo its Eazy on top even though Im short
Guaranteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
Gonna tip the laugh Im not a pranksta
Im serious Dre my sounds
So quit playin around
Cause Imma break it down
Last time I was takin my time with this
But other suckaz were makin a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten I was gettin riper
Ready to go like never before
Givin you more because Im ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin me destroy the suckaz thats softin
Curin diseases my rhyme pleases throw it a key
Balls havin seasons this is a doc trim
And Im locked in and I made up my mind
And I think Im gonna rock then
You got beaches chill and Imma push ya
To freeze after Ill cut ya cause Imma butcher
And say ya have pricin and then out ya go
Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
Messin with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
Im not a law man but Imma raw man
But ya the dopiest one I ever saw man
I keep droppin it pound for pound
And when Im on the mic I always throw down
To keep yall dancin to my funky sound
So listen now cause Imma break it down
Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme thats made
Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
Cause I dont need water to clear my throat
Comin from the rain the show is like dancin
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin
Wantin to get wit me this routine
Keepin it sprung still stayin mean
Can ya dis this man I dont think so
Once I start writin the way I let the ink go
Comin out with songs like hit after hit
Cause this is legit and yours aint shit
Makin it sound so dope cause Im a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin away like if I was on a sax
Doin a solo in the shade Im a spotlight relax and chill
While your uptight pumpin up the funky sounds
Yo you should know its kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down

Alright Go

So I tell ithow I know itJust hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggaz out frontn lottering and looting.

Waiting to spray shotgunMack and an AK

Go around tha corner come back real slow
Lights offcars in neutralrolln at a snails pace and creepn
Hoping to catch all of them sleepna so called gangdrugs and sex NWA
Start busting a cap and all tha others jet ofem fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scencewith gun shot wounds
 dead cause Compton is scanless.

Good evening and welcome to eazys playhouse
You stupid muthafucka

What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch
Easily I approach
The microphone because I aint no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
Im gonna hold it and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up Im goin to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
cause Im puttin lead in your mothafuckin ass
Psychopathic but the hoes are attracted
Because when Im on hard my dicks at least a yard
In the days of old I was a nut
Now I need at least  hoes when I fuck
cause I do a check nut  nut 
Then I save a nut for when theres nothin else to do
Get used to the crew bitch cause I would never quit
As soon as you think thats it Im still talkin shit
I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy thats my boy godamnit
I got a fable that you need to listen to
Its a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
s sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and Ill fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a onhold skeezer
Yeah thats the ticket Ill do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down eyes wide and said
Heres what Im gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit grab it lets work it
But I wont love you when Im done Id still be talkin shit 
That boyz good
Yeah that boys good
That mothafuckaz talkin all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
Youre mothafuckin lyin
How you know Im mothafuckin lyin
Youre lyin your dick cant get hard ..
Oh suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied

Wait a minute wait a minute cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy wantcha rewind it
Niggas dont see Im a % legit
And you know it aint about all that bullshit
Its about fuckin this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the  day itch like that ho
Just throwin me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
Shes bad nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move to skeaze me
Just to say "I got fucked by eazy"
So I slapped the ho like a pimp
Oi might be a womanbeater but Im not a pussyeater
So when the shit hits the fan its outta my mouth

All of yall can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause Im still talkin shit

a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at its own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin to free my kind
Im so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now Im back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim and then my thoughts fail
my mind is still fumblin with the present slavery
Im here to save you but whos to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms are all wet
I put finger on the button and then the sightll check
I make the kill heres the deal
after the triggers pulled then the death is sealed
so as the shots sing out like a piper
everyones scared of a neighborhood sniper

EazyE
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
and simply scared the bitch boo
being the E ya know Im thinkin devious thoughts

now the room is red
now theres nothing left but the snitch
heres a four leaf clover punk make a wish
one *Shot* two *Shot* three strikes your out
this nigga is dead and now Im lookin for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
duck into an alley so they dont recognize my face
the boy had to pay the piper
so they all stay in debt of a neighborhood sniper

EazyE
Im Doin dirt by myself as I continue my mission
killin all fools as an addiction
as the E lovin the game leavin the shame
and in my heart I feel no muthafuckin pain
because my heart is cold as I was told
and with the AK I stand bold
rippin up shit with the fury of my gun shot
pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
lovin the sight as the blood spills
take a photograph to keep in my hall of thrills Im stayin calm
and never hyper as I succeed in my mission
of bein a neighborhood sniper

Fillin up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because Im about to begin
And if you didnt hear me boy Ill tell you again
My name is eazy or just call me e
But it doesnt really matter to me
Cause Im the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin
I just gotta keep cursin
This is for the radio so I better chill
They wont play it if I could get ill
But Im like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I dont do dope but Im dope not a dope
But Im doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme Im dispayin
And the beat thats playin
Yo you could try all day
And you still wont match up with the ruthless p.o.w.
Cause eazys doin it compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo its eazyer said than dunn.
Wooooooo
Wooooooo
Now its easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya dont ya might get lost
Im not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo Im a gangsta
And Im about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the Eazwhye comma now thats drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
Im comin off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you dont need no glasses to stare
Itll probably take you in and its just like your there
With the e on the gangsta tip
So if you think Im a flip or slip dont even trip
Cause Im a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on ruthless and thats my label
To get the money the women and co bust the fat cables
Boy master rhymers of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya dont even know me
Get the gat show em where its at
And thats just the sound
And next time Im peelin ya cap
To let ya know where Im comin from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn
Wooooooo

Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazyer said than dunn yeah thats the title
Rubbin the ladys only the fly ones ya know

Eazy come eazy go
Dont ask to battle me home boy whats that
You want to battle me boy ya better be strapped
Cause where Im from it aint all about that playin
Now thats what Im sayin
Sevy thought that I was born in 
Now everybody wants to know the age
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin I was only fifteen
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin nothin ladys do
Cause the ladyz I luv em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
Im the real eazy cause others be fakin
Tryin to game fame off the name Im makin
Sayin on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its eazyer said than dunn.
Wooooooo

Get up on it on and on get on it
And I will pump it only if you want it.

Duh is a fool who dont ride to slide to a ride

Yo Ren youre ready to go get this move

Youre strapped
Yeah you know it
Lets go do this man I got it all planned out
Yeah shoot any motherfucker that moves
"Alright everybody"
This is a stickup everybody get facedown
Ren gag their mouths so they cant make a sound
Tie em up for the fact that Im kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat and Im tempted to blast
My name is Eazy but I go the hard way out
This aint personal but now Im about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what no need for shakin because Im used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah hes wearin a badge but hes a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang just cant be seen
Lock the doors and throw away the key
Close the blinds so no motherfuckers can see
And smile you know cause Im controllin the shit
And no sucker ass niggas gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs and a Ruthless shirt
That means Im ready to work and rush a fool to the dirt so
Repeat x
"Nobody moves nobody gets hurt"
Alright anybody move and Ill blow your fuckin head off
Alright
Empty your pockets but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin floor
Dont make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
Im in a bank and its a little bit funny
Takin all you stupid motherfuckers money
Peepin at a bitch cause my dicks on hard
Laughin at the dumb ass security guard
Whos tied up for the moment not sayin a word
I should have known it before the motherfuckers a nerd
But back to the bitches Im peepin
And then untie the hoe so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch with a gun in the back
I said "Lay down and unbutton your bra"
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said "Damn" then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind was goin up in her
The suspense was makin me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick
I said "Damn" dropped the gat from my hand
What I thought was a bitch was nothing but a man
Put the gat to his legs all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt so
Repeat x
"Nobody moves nobody gets hurt"
I said get down. I want you all facedown on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot
Stackin up the money and theres more to collect
Cause I dont give a fuck I take travelers checks
Yo Ren peep out the window and tell me what you see
 motherfuckin police starin at me; what to do now
Hurry up and get on
Allright tell me who is the motherfuckin alarm
Im a give ya a chance and count to three
Or else five of ya bitches are comin with me
Police Allright Allright come out niggaz or were coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in
Fuck you We got hostages and plenty of loot
And dont give a damn and not afraid to shoot
Were sendin out the hostages all except five
And if you dont meet our demands they wont stay alive
We want a copter so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along if you know what I mean
 hostage got brave and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
Police They shot a hostage they shot a hostage
MC Ren You stupid motherfucker tryin to run
Now youre dead as fuck tryin to race a gun
Police Allright this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages runnin and chokin
Gettin away but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they dont think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldnt fire the shit wouldnt work
So yall know what time it is
Repeat x
"Nobody moves nobody gets hurt"
Police Well Im giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or
Im gonna shoot two of your guards
Hehe they got me once but theyll never get me again
[endss]
[startss]
"We want eazy"
Well clap ya hands thencome on
Clap ya hands everybody
Clap ya hands come on come on
Put ya hands together and clap em
Now can yall say Eazy
Come on say it
EAZY
Everybody come on
EAZY
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin out the sound that Eazy is throwin down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin a way with dope style
Yo Eazy what ya gotta say
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy Es on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother whos smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because Im ruthless
When I spot a sucker I kill em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo its obvious tell em who you came to see
EAZY
Yeah cause this is the way I know you like it
So you wont strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that its done I know ya pleased
At how the E just dose it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin a girl dreamin
Just to get a picture of me n my BOYZ
From the HdoubleOD
N.W.A. down with me
Strong n Im ragin
Turn the page n
See Im not a son of a gun
Im a gauge n
Nothin can avoid this shot cause its hittin
Its so cool when you touch it wear a mitten
Im comin off raw into ya speaker
Makin the suckers on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo its obvious tell em who you came to see
EAZY
Aw never Im just too clever
So in fact that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned then I jet
To make another hit for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy does it
EAZY
We want Eazy
[endss]
[startss]
Gimmie this gimmie that gimmie this gimmie that
Bitch step back and dont try to jack

So you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care
Cause tshirts and khakies is all I wear
Im from the city where they show no pitty
For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that cisco I got a  on my pistol
Warrant by the LAPD
Key for puttin in work out my trade
Because the president never simp
 dumb dog to my residents

The Ruthlessnetwork driveby experts
Straight outta compton kickin up dust

Were sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that
How are you doing
All right
So Eazy tell me how was your life as a youngster 
Ruthless my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin  I specialized in gankin
whites Mexicans brothers and others
Daily its all about comin up
Makin sure no punks are runnin up
Because Im a gangster havin fun
Strapped with a gat when Im walkin through Compton
Terrible I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang sold undercover
Call a girl out a name yo I aint no lover
Im a pimp mack daddy lookin for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a sixfo Impala
Rollin and runnin from the police
Brother dont you know you cant trust a thief
or thug convict hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open gank for your stereo
Hard and raw no regard for the law
Eazy E were you ever caught slipping
Hell no Just trippin off eightball
And girls aint nothin but female dogs to me
Bitches Im sorry for that verse
Its in my nature I gotta curse
out anybody gettin on my nerves
You get beat ganked broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you dont like it I really dont give a damn
Hmm I see so youre rather violent
Sometimes
Ok what would be the situation when you socalled "gank" somebody
Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and its locked so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside I start takin
Cause you know its no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly but no runnin
Shht I think somebodys comin
Hear the front door key and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall dont fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions
Yes as a matter of fact there is
Have you ever been involved in like a armed robbery or a holdup
You mean a two hundred eleven 
Yeah
Theres a store but dont point
Walk inside case the joint
 man behind the counter another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask heres the task
Go in broke come out with cash
Were you slick
Yeah you gotta be cunnin
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin
Walked in said "This is a robbery"
Didnt need the money its just a hobby
Fill the bag homeboy dont lag
I want money beer and a pack of zigzags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E but he took one
Fell to the floor so I ran
back to the bucket then I said "Punch it"
Took the gun and then dumped it
Im not like Robin Hood cause I want more
Steal from the rich hang with the poor
My pockets are fat you see it dont matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true 
I dont lie
You see Im not mister nice guy
Oh so youre not exactly a role model
Not exactly
And for your listeners what does Eazy think of himself
Bad and bold you cant get with this
Those that tried youre on my hit list
Cant be caught sought or fought
thought and damn so what
Down and dirty from the CPT
NWA and EazyE
 more before we end this session
Whats your real name
No more questions

Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats
Because Im a ganster having fun

Hitting hard as fuck I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now Eazy does it
I was knocking motherfuckers out
Whats your name boy
Funky fresh EazyE
Kick kick that shit
Where you from fool Compton yea
Rolling through the hood cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say whats up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know thats an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 
Rolled them motherfuckers ate em up hit 
Got another point I made a ten a fo
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo
Laughing in their faces and said youre all making me rich

He shot gunshots Then I shot gunshots
As you can see I cold smoked his ass ha ha
Because Im a ganster having fun

Now Im a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker a sucker motherfucker
Hes addicted hes a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea I went to jail but that wasnt shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out Im gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said whats up
And said lets make a deal you know Ill do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do
Unloaded like hell cold smoked the ho
Because Im a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now Eazy does it
From around the way born in 
Hardcore Bboy named EazyE
Its  now s obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and % street

Hey yo Eazy Yo
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute
And bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rolled Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Down on Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JB is on freebase
The boy JB was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pull out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded  gauge
 sucker dead LA Times front page
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my  Impala
They greet me with a  and I start drinkin
And from the ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a rightcross and knocked his old ass out
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is cut for doin the crime
For defense on the boy hell do some time
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cuz I aint sayin shit
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
 days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
"Disruption of the court" said the judge
On a six year sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out "fire" then came Suzi
The bitch came in with a submachine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card

Schicke Fraun bouncen zu den fetten Beats
Aufm Kiez in den Jeeps da geschiehts

Was is los mit dem ganzen durchschnitt wir geben Stulle und machen kein Bullshit
Bin ich durch mit es ist Zeit zu fliegen
Oh mein Gott wie tight sind die denn
Refrain
Gehen ans Limit ohne Sturzhelm kannst do dir das bidde mal vorstelln
Kein Problem fÃ¼r uns wenn der SchÃ¤del brummt
Wenn Sebi dicke Beats in deine Vene pumpt
Jedes Wort is mÃ¤chtig rekordverdÃ¤chtig
Wenn ich alle Leute die meckern sofort ins Bett schick
Steig ein und setzt dich wir gehen ans Limit
Aber bitte benimm dich bin ich schon da oder spinn ich
Ich glaubs ja nicht was wird hier aufgetischt
Nach der ganzen Rohkost kommt das Hauptgericht
Der Sound ist dick dreh auf den Shit Noch doller

Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur fÃ¼r uns gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Wo der Sternenhimmel fÃ¼r uns lacht
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne
Von deinen Schultern
FÃ¤llt die ganze Last
Du spÃ¼rst sie nie wieder
Die Erdanziehungskraft
Und sollt es wirklich passieren
Dass wir uns im Universum verlieren
Dann verglÃ¼h ich fÃ¼r dich
Damit du niemals erfrierst
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur fÃ¼r uns gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Wo der Sternenhimmel fÃ¼r uns lacht
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne
Schwerelos
Wir fÃ¼hlen uns schwerelos
Schwerelos
Wir fÃ¼hlen uns schwerelos
Deine Zweifel waren groÃ
Niemand hat sich interessiert
Du spÃ¼rst wie es langsam leichter wird
Das schlimmste ist jetzt hinter dir
Du bist noch ganz benommen
Wir sind bald angekommen
Du brauchst jetzt nicht mehr zu weinen
Denn ich hab dich an die Hand genommen
Manchmal muss man einfach raus
Denn manchmal ist die Welt zu klein
Willst du die Unendlichkeit
Dann lass dich fallen und steig mit ein
Ich zeig dir wahre Liebe
Und wie gut es tut die Faust zu ballen
Wir fliegen vom Dunklen ins Sonnenlicht
Bis wir zu Staub zerfallen
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur fÃ¼r uns gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Wo der Sternenhimmel fÃ¼r uns lacht
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen fÃ¼r uns in weiter Ferne

Komm steig in das Raumschiff
Wir bringen den Sound mit
Diese Kids habens Faustdick
Hinter den Ohren
Wir genieÃen den Ausblick unglaublich
Deichkind
Wieder da mach mal sehr laut
Wir holen noch mehr raus
Verschmilz mit dem Abriss
Das Licht am Ende des Tunnelblicks packt dich
Steiger das Tempo
Wir sind dein Begleiter zur Unendlichkeit und noch weiter
Zeitlos. Ihr hÃ¶rt Hightech zeigt mehr Seiten als das World Wide Web
Lasst uns die Kontrolle verlieren. Hinterm Horizont grenzenlos amÃ¼sieren
Der Startknopf ist zum Greifen nah. Wir fliegen dort hin wo noch keiner war
Heiz den Bass auf wir wollen abfahren
SchmeiÃ den Hass raus wir wollen Platz sparen
Heiz den Bass auf wir wollen abfahren
Komm steig mit ein
Wir fahren jetzt los
Die Zeit steht sill
Die Welt ist groÃ
Nur du und ich
Der Schmerz erlischt
Nur du und ich
Wir gehen durchs Licht
Wir gehen da raus jetzt. Besser wenn du deinen Helm aufsetzt
ReiÃen die Schallmauer wie ne Wand ein
Mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit es sollte dir bekannt sein
Gaffa getapet damit du cool bleibst
Seit R.E.D. ein ganz neuer Urknall
Wir fÃ¼hlen uns wie frisch geboren
Willkommen auf der Flucht nach vorn
Heiz den Bass auf wir wollen abfahren
SchmeiÃ den Hass raus wir wollen Platz sparen
Heiz den Bass auf wir wollen abfahren
Komm steig mit ein
Wir fahren jetzt los
Die Zeit steht sill
Die Welt ist groÃ

Ich checke meine Mail auf dem Segway
Was sind das hier fÃ¼r Leute am Backstage
Sag mir bitte wie ich entspannen soll
FÃ¼ll die Wanne mit MoÃ«t
Aber randvoll
Dicker wo ist mein Plasma
Didi hat den Kram auch
Also mach mal
Ich wedle mit den iPads und ScheiÃdreck und kaum verkauft ist der Hype weg
Auf dem Weg zum Hotel will ich Quad fahren
Soll sich der Praktikant dafÃ¼r opfern
Hab ich nicht gesagt rote GummibÃ¤rchen
Komm erzÃ¤hl mir keine MÃ¤rchen
Oh Mann das nervt mich
Der Schampus perlt nicht
Ein bisschen mehr Niveau wÃ¤hre herrlich
Nach dem Auftritt bitte keine Party
Man schÃ¤le mir die Smarties
Ich will EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein
EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein
Au
Ich guck in mein GetrÃ¤nk am Privatstrand
Wieso ruft mich kein Arsch an
Nicht mal geschÃ¤ftlich
Alles lÃ¤uft hier wie geschmiert und es stresst mich
Was ist das fÃ¼r ein Prolet dieser Batman
Ich habe heut noch ein Date bei den BackHands
Ich bin wieder solo oh no
Der must have ist ein NoGo
FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck im Golfclub
Sind im Caddy auch die Sitze gepolstert
Was bummeln die hier rum ihr sollt helfen
Immer dieses Bellen "Bring die Limo fÃ¼r die Welpen"
Komm mach zu ich will um  Uhr zu Haus sein
SchlieÃlich sammele ich die Awards ein
Viel zu viel BMWs vor der HaustÃ¼r
Glaub mir ich muss raus hier
Ich will EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein
EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein
Au
Ich hacke meine Beats in die Tasten
Im meinem dream sind mir FlÃ¼gel gewachsen yeah
Reimender KuschelbÃ¤r
Mein Pulli wo komm die Fusseln her
Also diese Art ist unglaublich
Ich verlange Lob vor dem Auftritt
Ich trete hier nicht auf bei der Gage
Hotel reserviert dir die ganze Etage
Ich fordere HandtÃ¼cher schnell
Er sagt 
Sag mal ist die Deko vom Flohmarkt
Ganz schlechte QualitÃ¤t dieses Sofa
Ey nerv nicht mit Fanpost
Ich trachte nach Trennkost
Ich insistiere beharrlich
Ich bin ein Star
Und ihr seid gar nichts
Ich will EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein
EiswÃ¼rfel in Pyramidenform
In mein Lieblingsdrink hinein
Das ist ein Pferd aus Glas
GefÃ¼llt mit Bier
Wenn ich das sag wird es so sein

Fuck Saturn und MediaMarkt euer Kaufhaus mÃ¼ffelt
Wir schlieÃen eure Tore zu und schlucken dann den SchÃ¼ssel.

Eine Prise Mythos
Ein Tropfen Hysterie
Auf keinen Fall bedanken
Es herrscht strikte Hierarchie
Wir befehlen euch zu feiern
Euch an uns zu berauschen
Und wenn ihr dadurch pieschern mÃ¼sst
Dann lasst es einfach laufen
Man bringe uns ein Opfer
Vorne vom Foyer
Die FÃ¼Ãe von der Klofrau wÃ¤rn fÃ¼r uns okay
Der Befehl kommt von ganz unten
Die Magie der Tiere wirkt
Wir dulden keinen Anstand
Weil er Freigeister verwirrt
Hab ich gesagt machst du so
Hab ich gesagt mach so
Hab ich gesagt machst du so
Hab ich gesagt mach so
Hab ich gesagt machst du so
Hab ich gesagt mach so
Hab ich gesagt machst du so
Hab ich gesagt mach so
Wir wissen ihr vertraut uns
Power ohne Zweifel
Pogo ohne Pause
Nun dreht euch wie ein Kreisel
SchlÃ¤uche und Randale
Konfettisturm und Plastik
Das passiert nicht aus hen
Wir machen das mit Absicht
Danke fÃ¼r die Klicks
DafÃ¼r kÃ¶nn wir uns nix kaufen
Als ehrliche EntschÃ¤digung mÃ¼sst ihr den Takt jetzt saufen
Der Poltergeist Santana
Rasselt mit sein Ketten
Und inhaliert ganz ungeniert DeichkindZigaretten
Hab ich gesagt machst du so

wir Ã¶ffnen euch die TÃ¼r
ihr seid bis Sonntag nicht zu Haus
wir kÃ¶nn da nix dafÃ¼r
wir schreiben euer Zeugnis
die Zukunft wird gepresst
der Tunnelblick der Dynastie
Gibt euch dann den Rest
Reibungslose Orgien
Die Schule ist verbrannt
Low Kick High Kick
Wie JeanClaude Van Damme
Der Befehl kommt von ganz unten
Wir erziehn euch um
Gott lutscht gern am Zitzentank
Wir nehm es ihm nich krumm

Ich will hier weg
Ich muss hier raus
Denn diese Welt ist traurig dreckig und laut
Der Countdown lÃ¤uft.
Feuer und Rauch
Die Welt wird klein und ich fliege immer gerade aus.
Ein Traum wird wahr ich steige aus.
Und ich steh wie erstarrt zwischen Stein und Staub.
Der Himmel ist Schwarz und der Boden ist Grau.
Und wohin ich auch geh mehr gibts nicht zu sehn
Das hÃ¤tt ich nie geglaubt.
âDer Mond ist Tod. Es gibt kein Leben auf dem Mond.
Er ist kalt auch wenn er strahlt. VÃ¶llig leer und unbewohnt.
Der Mond ist Tod.

Ich will zurÃ¼ck.
Will wieder nach Haus.
Da wo Menschen sind.
Wo es warm ist und so schÃ¶n vertraut.
Denn was ich jetzt weiÃ.
Ist dass ich Sie brauch.
Der Mond wird klein und ich fliege immer gerade aus.
Steige aus und schau hinauf.
âDer Mond ist Tod. Es gibt kein Leben auf dem Mond.
Er ist kalt auch wenn er strahlt. VÃ¶llig leer und unbewohnt.

Er ist kalt auch wenn er strahlt. VÃ¶llig leer und unbewohnt.
