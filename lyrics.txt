Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Yeah  
Too late  
I cant keep chasing em  
Im taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that Ive made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed  
But Ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
Im a take control of this relationship  
Command it and Im a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while Ive stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
Ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this Ill no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath  
You know what youve done no need to go in depth  
I told you youd be sorry if I fucking left  
Id laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free youve said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its  
  
  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
  
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Dont think Im loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Dont I give you enough of my time  
You dont think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why Im married to you still man I dont know  
But tonight Im serving you with papers  
Im divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you  
Feed em the same shit you made me eat  
Im moving on forget you oh  
Now Im special Oh I didnt feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
Im addicted  
To the pain the stress the drama  
Im drown in so I guess Im a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time Im a  
Aint changing my mind  
Im climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that Ill be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
You left me off your list  
  
Fuck you hiphop  
Im leaving you my life sentence is served bitch  
And its just  
  
  
  
Too late  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life

Ohyea ohyea ohyea  
Oh oh  
Oh  
Ohyea ohyea ohyea ohyeaohyea  
Oh  
Woah  
There is no escaping yoyo  
Theres no place to hideyoyo  
You scream someone save meyoyo  
But they dont pave no mind yo yo  
Good night  
Good bye  
  
Your walkin down a horror corridor  
Its almost four in the mornin  
And your in a nightmare  
Its horrible  
Right theres the coroner  
Waitin for you  
To turn the corner  
So he can corner ya  
Your a goner  
Hes on a ya  
Out the corner of his cornea  
He just saw you run  
All you want is to rest  
Cause you cant run anymore  
Your done  
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience  
While everybody  
Is watchin in the party applauding it  
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again  
Contemplating my next plot again  
Swallowin a colata pin  
While Im noddin  
In and out on the ottoman and  
If the Ramada Inn  
Holdin onto the pill bottle then  
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom  
And make sure I got all of it  
Wake up naked at Mcdonalds  
With  
Blood all over me  
Dead bodies  
Behind the counter  
Shit  
Guess I must of just blacked out again  
Not again  
  
  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
I said  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
  
Sitting nude in my living room  
Its almost noon  
I wonder whats on the tube  
Maybe theyll show some boobs  
Surfing every channel  
Until I find Hannah Montana  
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin  
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin  
Every candle on top of the fire place  
Mantalin  
Grab my flannel and my bandana then  
Kiss the naked manequin man again  
You can see him standin in my  
Front window  
If you look in  
Im just a hooligan  
Whos use to usin hallucinogens  
Causin illusions again  
Brain contusions again  
Cutting and bruising the skin  
Raise the scissors and pins  
Jesus when does it end  
Phases that I go through  
Dazed and not so confused  
Days that I dont know who  
Gave these molecules too  
Me  
What am I gone do  
Hey the prodigal son  
The diabolical one  
Very methodical  
When I slaughter dem  
  
  
  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
  
I duck and I slash slice and gash  
Last night was a blast  
I cant quite remember when I  
Had that much fun  
Off a half pint fifth of Jack  
My last Vic and a half  
A flashlight  
Up Kim Kardashians ass  
  
I remember the first time  
I dismembered the family member  
December I think it was  
I was having drinks with my cousin  
And I wrapped him  
In Christmas lights  
Pushed him into the stinkin tub  
Cut him up into pieces  
Then just when I went to drink his  
Blood  
I thought I outta drink his bath water  
That outta be fun  
Thats when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun  
The sight of blood excites me  
That might be an artery son  
Your blood coverin screams  
Just dont seem to bother me none  
Its three am  
And here I come  
So you should probably run  
A secret passage way around here  
Man theres got to be one  
Oh no theres probably none  
He can scream all that he wants  
Top of his lungs  
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him upup  
  
  
  
yo yo  
A yo a yo  
yo yo  
A yo a yo

Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless  
Patrolling corners  
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters  
Im meaner in action  
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer   
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments  
I grew up in the wild hood  
As a hazardous youth  
With a fucked up childhood  
That I used as an excuse  
And aint shit changed  
But kept the same mindstate  
Since the third time that I failed th grade  
You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it  
I dont promote violence I just encourage it  
I laugh at the sight of death  
As I fall down a cement flight of steps  
And land inside a bed of spider webs  
So throw caution to the wind  
You and a friend  
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again  
shit why not Blow your brain out  
Im blowing mine out  
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now  
  
Its only fair to warn  
I was born with a set of horns  
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord  
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board  
That smashed into your Honda Accord  
With a  door Ford  
But Im more toward droppin an accapella  
And choppin a fella  
To mozarella  
Worse than a hellacopta propella  
Got you locked in the cella  
With your skeleton showing  
Developing anorexia  
While Im standin next to ya  
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death  
With an iv in your veins  
Feeding you liquid darvicet  
Pumping you full of drugs  
Pull the plugs  
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
Who were picked up in an ambulance  
And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
And given  
A less than  percent chance  
Of living  
Have a possible placement  
Its a hospital patient  
Storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement  
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived  
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "IM STILL ALIVE"  
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth  
Better call the fire department  
Ive hired a arson  
To set fire to carpet  
And burn up your entire apartment  
Im a liar to start shit   
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick  
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit  
  
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg  
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the   
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula D  
fuck an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
Im blowin up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas  
Cross the bombas   
We blowin up your house killing your parents  
And coming back to get your foster mommas  
And Im as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets  
Im more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more cause I smoked crack   
Today yesterday and the day before sabbath  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Buncha missle launchers n a buncha contra  
Banvan full of ganja now come on ja

Doin the chacha and the cucaracha with a quadra  
Polegic boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."  
Lindsey to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya  
Whod a knew the pewd a do to me what its done  
Such sinasism when it isnt in my system.  
Bluntigmatism betta spliff up to my lips son  
So much on my hands I gotta give my kids a fistbump.  
Christopher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks  
"Mista help me"s what he said to me and then sunk.  
Women skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks  
In clumps the woman with cocoabutter skin once.  
  
  
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
Skin em up hem em sew em up in those kilts  
Up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts.  
Man you dont want to go up in those hills  
Up in those hills uppaup in those hills.  
You better beware stay clear of Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
  
Always you can see him lurkin in the hallways  
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.  
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place  
Hide em in the wall well how long will the drywall take  
Well fuck it then Ive got nothin but time Ill wait.  
Until it dries for the moment I guess youre all safe.  
After I sand it and buff it I guess that Ill paint  
My chainsaws outta gas my regular saw aint.  
Now here I come again damn stomach rumblin  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within.  
Someones in the back of my damn house rummagin  
Its a girl she looks pretty thin but I want her skin.  
Been on the hunt again when will it ever end  
Evelyn why you tryin to fight You will never win.  
Severin legs arms damn there goes another limb.  
Pull the lever then trap door death is evident.

Fuckin hoe ya better fuckin hold still.  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket dont spill.  
Cut em gut em n just get to stuffin those girls.

And push it right through her while ya put your shishkebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl whos skins newer"  
"In a world of sindoer this is turnin into a  
Torment tournament of sorts Christmas ornaments you are."  
Ill be sure to Ginsue ya til theres no more skin to ya.  
Booya who ya think your fuckin with  
Duck because here he comes again.

You bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest most rawest form flow almost flawless

Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God Saddams got his own Laden  
With his own private plane his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges boom sound  
Oranges peach pears plums syringes  
Yeah here I come  
Im inches away from you here fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of  so

Must be a circus in town lets shut the shit down  
On these clowns can I get a witness  
Hell Yeah  
  
Quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When Im gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So skip to ya Lou while I do what I do best  
You aint even impressed no more you used to it  
Flows too wet nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
Theres no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin and you know what for  
The show must go on so Id like to welcome yall  
To  and Andres carnival  
Come on Now

 old friends why panic  
You already whos fully capable the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin a sweat  
People steppin over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats and be so breezy  
Jesus how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MCs dont see me  
Believe me BET and MTV  
Are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo sheezy  
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me  
Til we grow beards get weird and disappear into the mountains

Until our dying day until were old and gray  
  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening  
  
Oh Ha


So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isnt how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shitd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldnt quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no inbetween  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three then three  
Years later theyd go back and rerate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The  Mathers was a classic  
The  Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just aint passed yet  
A couple more years that shitll be illmatic  
And eight years later Im still at it  
Divorce remarried  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I got a letter from a fan that said  
Hes been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
Its been weighing on my mind heavy  
Cause I dont read every  
Letter I get but something told me to go ahead and open it but  
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you  
You didnt pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where Im at  
Ive already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got  
God on my side  
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it  
Just watchin it from an opposite standpoint  
Man boys got to look  
Nuts  
And thats the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold


You are now listening to the sounds ofShady
andAlchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist  
Got an axe in the duffel bag couple of fags  
Stuffed in the backseat muzzled n gagged  
Wrapped in bubble wrap two lesbians ahh  
Couple hustler mags now grab the pez dispenser  
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers  
The governor of Alaska She lusts when I ask her  
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh  
While we hover over Nebraska  
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture  
In the helicopter man I cant fuck her no faster  
Shes screaming grab my titties shady suck on those bastards  
But I aint no sucker I wont snuggle up with her after  
Im a gigolo But Yall look like the juggalo rapper  
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper  
Shit Back down  
Man Id rather lick on a scrotum  
And eat the fucking octa Moms pussy lips with some okra  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg Sizzle with Oprah  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa  
Getting home and play dick swords with the JonasBrothers  
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers Like no other  
I keep thinking of her smothered in somas  
Its chemical warfare Drop bombs like sadam  
Im bringing the drama Like Barrack Obama  
Playing rock em sock em robots with the Octo Mama  
Im vato loco homie Ill cock those llamas  


Wheres my snare  
I have no snare in my headphones  
There you go yeah yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against  
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep goin  
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin  
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evening  
Leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Aint you mama Im a make you look so ridiculous now  
  
  
I said Im sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I dont know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
Im a expose it Ill take you back to   
Before I ever had a multiplatinum sellin CD  
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her side  
Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailies sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but Im only human  
But Im man enough to face them today  
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause Id a killed them shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life Id like to welcome yall to The  Show  
  
  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin yo mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin  
Goin through public housing systems victim of Munchhausens syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt  
Til I grew up now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it  
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma  
Well guess what your gettin older now and  
Its cold when your lonely and Nathans growin up so quick  
Hes gonna know that your phony  
And Hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful  
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong  
Bitch do your song  
Keep tellin yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get  
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be  
  



  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
     
This was a beat with no words at first its a blank painting  
Exercising the mind its brain strength training  
Starts off something like shadys an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady thats a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name baby  
Wife beaters and white tshirts  
Hanes mainly its a long shot but is it possible  
Theres a lane maybe  
If not hes gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his fcking name feinting  
Shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore hes ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And hes about to be raped by this game anally.  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
     
Youre operating on all cylinders  
Syllables spit like dillingers  
Spilling your guts  
People are feeling your mic skills  
But these haters are ice grillin ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya die for ya  
But you cant decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasnt like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
But this is what you wanted  aint it  
Fck no the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship  
With another girl this World is a fcking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed take another hit  
Sniff til I fcking url  
Tell em all to fcking sit and spin til they fcking twirl  
Middle finger up again  
Relapsing back in this game oh well fck it then  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted


Ladies and gentlemen  
The moment youve all been waiting for  
In this corner weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds  
With a record of seventeen rapes four hundred assaults and four murders  
The undisputed most diabolic villain in the world  
Slim Shady  
  
  
So crack a bottle let your body waddle  
Dont act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto  
Ooh ooh bitches hopping in my Tahoe  
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now wheres the rubbers Whos got the rubbers  
I noticed theres so many of them  
And theres really not that many of us.  
Ladies love us my posses kicking up dust.  
Its on till the break of dawn  
And were starting this party from dusk  
  
OK lets go  
  
Back with Andre the giant mister elephant tusk  
Picture us youll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.  
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.  
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.  
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought  
Cause when I spit the verse the shit  
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect works every time  
Every verse every line as simple as nursery rhymes  
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.  
I venture to say were the center of attention its true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal  
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trios back on you hoes.  
  
  
  
Ladies and gentlemen   
  
  
They see that low rider go by theyre like Oh my  
You aint got to tell me why youre sick cuz I know why.  
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.  
Im an itch that they cant scratch they sick of me.  
But hey what else can I say I love LA.  
Cause over and above all its just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends.  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.  
Ill be dammed just fucked around and crashed my Benz.  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Lets cash that one in.  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know.  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl  
Decisions decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision.  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though  
  
  
  
And I take great pleasure in introducing  Cent  
  
Its bottle after bottle  
The money aint a thing when you party with me  
Its what we into its simple  
We ball out of control like you wouldnt believe  
Im the napalm the bomb the don Im King Kong  
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on  
Im so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm  
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want  
Nigga on and on till the break of what

Blow it like its supposed to be blown

Rappers try to play me they use Hailie as a ukulele  
Woopsa that a fucking daisy  
Thats a nono who even she knows Dadas fucking crazy

Maybe its because I never had a mother raise me  
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

But its all caught up to me now karmas in the waters  
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner  
You might think it doesnt creep upon ya but it all does  
You wouldnt listen man I tried to warn ya when you started

They get so mad when I call them both fagots

Talking Obie Trice  
New shit Obie Trice   
Get familiar wit it  
  
  Obie Trice  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homies verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
Thats why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
Im so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and aint spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
    
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin its a fuckin mimick when it aint  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus Uranus  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein crazed  
You dont think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs  
  
Talking   
This is Shade   
You know how motherfuckin serious this shit is  
This shit is so motherfuckin serious


I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But Im sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And Ive been drinking myself to sleep my souls crushed  
A couple more shots I know Im gonna go nuts  
I cant deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself what a tragedy  
And now what do I do  
Where do I go  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
Its hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me its sane  
And I like it why cause I feel like were still united  
In some weird way I dont wanna fight it  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didnt write back  
Its like that after all the crap we been through  
I cant believe you I know I fucked up  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up  
You keep sending me to voicemail  
Im annoyed hell shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But youre probably busy kissing someone elses lips  
While Im sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit  
Youre hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself yeah I did it  
Without you Im nothing dont you get it  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met I cant believe you just said that  
Youre so cold you just hit me so low  
I cant take this no more so hit the road  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just dont seem the way they do  
 day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
Youre telling me you hate me youre leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I cant get you outta of my head  
So Im out of bed at  in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I cant do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
Whats on my mind and whats going through it  
Cause if I dont Ill probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching Im medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I dont even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldnt matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight

They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best  
JayZ and Kanye West maybe theyre just tryna distract it  
From the fact that Im comin back  
Or maybe its cause I aint black maybe its because of that  
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap  
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques  
Im still sick how can I be sick this long  
And Im still alive Magic Johnson arise  
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died  
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there

Life  
By Marshal Mathers  
What is life  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
Its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies with secret identities  
And disguises to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin  
  
What is money  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Moneyll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life  
Im tired of life  
Im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
Im tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
Im tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
Im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off  
Im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why Im smartin off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
Im tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand  
Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on  
While Im on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough  
Because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
Im tired of being white trash broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
Im tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a BM  
Tired of not working at GM tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
Im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
Im tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me  
Saying they wasnt feeling me when nobodys as ill as me  
Im tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of JLbe saying "Where HipHop Lives"  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on while Im on the john  
  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
You know what Im saying  
Im tired of all of this bullshit  
Telling me to be positive  
Howm I sposed to be positive when I dont see shit positive  
Know what Im sayin  
I rap about shit around me shit I see  
Know what Im sayin  
Right now Im tired of everything  
Tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city  
Cant get no airplay you know what Im sayin  
But ey its cool though you know what Im sayin  
Just fed up  
Thats my word


Damn it feels good to be back  
Im having a relapse  
  
How the hell did he manage  
To get more felony charges  
Hes already got life in jail  
Man what the hell is his problem  
  
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic  
They compelled me  
To kill this elderly man  
  
And I get these panic attacks  
Pop a xanax relax  
Try to stick my fucking dick  
Inside a mannequins ass  
  
Then I get manic depressed  
And the orthodontist get gas masked  
Kick ass  
The first thing Ill put on is the mask  
  
Speaking of masks man  
It aint to late to have a change of pace  
And take it off and show my face  
So you can see the things you face  
And slice you up  
And cook you after your murder  
By strangulation  
  
thats bacon souffle  
You making aint you  
Well thank you jason  
  
There goes one more coma  
Due to blunt force trauma  
Just give me one more soma  
And Ill be done for it mama  
  
Go in the damn broom closet  
Another valium lost it  
Shovin the vacuums nozzle  
Down the bathroom faucet  
  
It seems like every day I get a little flakier  
The medication is making my hands a little shakier  
Hand me that  month old baby  
To shake him up  
Itll only take me a second to choke his trachea  
Breaking his neck in  some places  
  
Baby here shady comes lady  
Hes got the razor bablades and the chachachainsawsaw baby  
You bebeblundering bumbling mmmumbling dumm dumms  
Yeah here I come come you hear the rumbling vrum vrum  
  
theres something inside of that blue tarp  
And that drum drum  
A head and torso of someone  
Whered it come from  
  
Whos it belong to  
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair  
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms  
Clearly theres somen wrong  
Cause she didnt come home  
  
shes missing  
Where is she  
Something fishy is going on  
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs  
  
Now everybody get your dance on  
To my damn song  
Cmon


Oh yeah this is  baby  
Back up in that motherfucking ass  
 time for your mother fucking mind  
We represent the   
You know what Im saying cause they dont know shit about this  
For the   
  
Ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction  
To get your brain relaxing a zany acting maniac in action  
A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction  
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run  
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills  
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills  
Im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants  
Twist the necks of rappers til their spinal column disconnects  
We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up  
Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog  
This is the season for noise pollution contamination  
Examination of more cartoons than animation  
My lamination of narration  
Hits a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation  
When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing  
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense  
I got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse  
I greet the gents and ladies I spoil loyal fans  
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans  
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal  
 thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people  
MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium  
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one  
Imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator  
Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus  
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases  
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces  
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis  
And eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally  
With entity dementedly meant to be infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Man I got evidence Im never dense and I been clever ever since  
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO  
So Im assuming all responsibility  
Cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs  
Mic messaler slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical  
Id rather let a tactical tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I cant see or cant imagine  
A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit  
Im tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it

They said once bitten n twice shy  
We lie next to the guy  
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra  
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir  
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser  
Its my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester  
Drop kick the bits before a second trimester  
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser  
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her  
  
  
I guess its time for you to hate me again

The world is just my medicine ball your all in

The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her  
Imagine if visual for that man  
Who woulda thought  
Could ever be such a relentless prick  
And leashin his fingers  
For the chicks who waltz  
She looks like she outlived her life sentence  
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive  
If you werent so defensive it wouldnt be  
Your so sensitive

Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick  
Pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit  
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit  
Drink gin til my chins full of splashed whiskers  
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches  
Ask Bizzy hes been here the past six years  
Mash with me youll get in imagine this  
  
  
  
I fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mothers throat  
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope  
My little sisters birthday shell remember me  
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity  
And bitches know me as a hornyass freak  
Their mother wasnt raped I ate her pussy while she was sleep  
Pissydrunk throwin up in the urinal you fuckin homo  
Thats what I said at my dads funeral  
  
  
  
Thats why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still  
Thats why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed  
Thats why we dont call it Detroit we call it Amityville Ville  
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled filled  
Thats why were crowned the murder capital still still  
This aint Detroit this is motherfuckin Hamburger Hill Hill  
We dont do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot  
And when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too  
Thats the mentality here here thats the reality here here  
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh  
While Im holdin a pistol with this many calibers here here  
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year year  
Cause once I snap I cant be held accountable for my actions  
Thats when accidents happen  
When a thousand bullets come at your house  
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you  
And your family in it Ah  
God dammit he meant it when he told you  
  



Police voice  
Attention all units attention all units  
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair  
I repeat we have an APB on a man with green hair  
Hes armed with a knife I repeat hes armed with a knife  
Proceed with caution watch your back fellas  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
   
Theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
Hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm  
Hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm look for a man with green hair  
Check at your girls house he was last seen there  
Hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes  
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
We got the walkietalkies to keep us all informed  
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post  
And most of all be advised that hes wise  
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
Im on a solo mission to find him personally  
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
Its sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
Im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
"Give me your girlfriend or Im gonna kill ya"  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where Im at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned  
Theyre only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone  
  
Police voice  
Attention all cars attention all cars  
Unit  has apprehended the suspect  
Hes going back to the crazy home I repeat  
Hes going back to the crazy home how about that  
  
   
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good

How could I begin  
  
Locked in Mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch  
Was red wine more red wine and Captain Crunch  
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch  
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch  
Mariah whats ever happened to us why did we have to break up  
All I asked for was a glass of punch  
You see I never really ask for much  
I cant imagine whats going through your mind after such  
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk  
Weisman Gale Nick Cannon better back the fuck up  
Im not playin I want to bag ya punk  
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk  
Mixed with Egyptian with a little rappin pump  
Zappin Eric Clapton Shaft Frank Zappa crunk  
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya  
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want  
I mean I really want you bad you cunt  
Nick you had your fun  
Ive come to kick you in your sack of junk  
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood  
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture  
  
  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
When will it ever cease for Petes sake hes crazy to say the least  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Whats going through my mind half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause Im gone blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad  
  
You can be a permanent fixture  
In my lyrical mixture  
Im the miracle whit trixter  
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks around  
Im bound to put on in an instant wow  
Man what an ensemble what an assortment of pharma  
Ceuticals its beautiful pill dust in my palm my  
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle  
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama  
Ill cut you like Dahmer pull a butcher knife on ya  
The size of a sword boy Im like a fucken Red Sonia  
Get it stuck in your cornea  
Nice knowin ya Norman  
Youre so fuckin annoyin  
Drop the shovel boy you dont know what the fuck ya doin  
I aint playin no fuckin more  
Nick Cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore  
Every minute theres a sucker born  
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn  
Shuck of shuck of corn shuck of corn  
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him its fucken on  
What the fuck are you doin  
Youre runnin over the snow blower  
With the lawnmower blow on your  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
  
  
  
In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables  
I bet you they become heterosexual  
Nothing will stop me from molesting you  
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle  
Flesh tickles my testicles  
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins  
Hows it going girlfriends you need a boyfriend  
You need some ointment just make an appointment  
Whos gonna see the doctor first well do a coin flip  
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip  
When the bad get going how bad does the going get  
Baby you shouldnt have any trouble rubbing groins wit  
Each other especially when youre joined at the hip  
Im going to get the needle new thread from the sewing kit  
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit  
Lured the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip  
Cookie lookie even took me a polaroid bitch  
  
  
  
Vocoder Humdelaylelahaaahhhhhhh 


Dj scratching  "Do it"  
  
  
  
Sneakin in through the back door fruity mcs get ambushed  
Rammed and squooshed slammed and pushed crammed and mushed  
Then Im movin on down from the right to left  
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death  
To get jacked attacked and cracked in two  
Smackin through til youre black and blue for actin true  
Im dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands  
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans  
Im stompin Im kickin Im chokin Im stampin em  
Clompin em stickin and pokin and clampin em  
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts  
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts  
Im zappin rappers singers and dancers  
Faster than you could snap your figures for ransom  
Cancer is in the flesh alive and breathin  
Survivin by connivin and theivin  
  
Dj scratching  "Do it" "Eat em up"  
  
  
  
I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters  
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders  
Developin a fear of biterphobia  
Im holdin a gas can and lighter over ya  
If I detect ya Ima pulverize  
Dissect your brain diggin in your skull for lies  
And Ima torture with material iller  
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer  
Im more dangerous than a loaded chamber is  
A major risk to a plagiarist  
So beware of the aura A terror for the horrible  
Will scare ya tomorrow is the airbourne assault of the rappers  
Hit the source to better my skills  
I head for the border  
And run the Galloping Hills the choice is yours  
Cause now buddys noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse  
Cause Im sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage
yours to bite like labradors  
In the range of my doublebarrel  
And your life is in danger trouble and peril  
  
Dj scratching  
  
  
  
I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires  
Cuz vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers  
And swing on my big thingamajig  
So Im bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig  
Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that Ive said over reels  
Thats how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So Im forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and its ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative  
Pronouns and verbs predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya  times outta   
Thats why Im spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen  
  
Dj scratching  "Everybody walk out the back door"  
  
Dj scratching to fade


Yo check it out its fucked up and I dont see either one of us budging  
  
Im withholding my anger  
Though Id like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussys puny neck  
Its my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
Thats what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He dont exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And its destroying him slowly  
Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now hes acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he cant pull me so hes mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
Cause it annoys him to see that I aint scared  
  
You aint no motherfucking bully  
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking bully  
I wont allow it aint no coward to no bully  
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally  
  
Now Im not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
Theres so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that Im down with   
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja laughter  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irvs on a string  
And Irvs so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough  
And Murder Inc.s the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our buildings made out of bricks  
So you aint taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
cause you know we dont play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much E  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hiphop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs Slayed Son and Freaky Ta  
Its like a neverending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyones gotta be so fucking hard  
Im not excluding myself  
cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go but then again  
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
Its no exception it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesnt kill him  
Someone from GUnit will and I aint buzzed  
Dawg Im talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halies name  
  
Irvine get your boy off that E  
  
Get at me dawg  
Holla


Scratched sample  "Im the man"  
  
I stand in by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am and may reply with a grin  
Yes Im tired of being  
Why should I be secluded I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell " will you kick it for me"  
So I find myself in a certaindepligatory  
A place where I dwell in for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time  
Finally let loose unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus"  
Is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading  
Fading from existence cause simulations are dead  
Theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor  
While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
Scratched samples  "Yeah" "Its another  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
"Oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do  
You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to"  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and  
Youre dull its time you faced this here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend  
  
Scratched samples  "Yeah" "Its another"  
  
You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that were your enemy  
  
On the floor lies a broken door cause Im not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But Ive apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted  
Pull up the quick  
These we hate him these are past us huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spots already occupied and I dont play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine  
But Im always having to proove myself time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and hes put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning attack me side Im like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please  
Ive got a craving  
  
Scratched sample until end  "Im the man"


Tell myself that I was doin all right  
Theres nothin left to do tonight  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
Cant you see what you do to me baby  
You make me crazy you make me act like a maniac  
Im like a lunatic you make me sick  
Youre truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
 minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe thats a bad habit  
Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We cant figure out if its lust  
Or its love which that is attractin us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if theres one thing about you that I admire  
Its baby because you stay with me  
Maybe cause youre as crazy as I am  
Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side like a devil in disguise  
Youre always full of surprises  
Always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
Youre only twenty four but youre plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like theyre in middle school still youre crazy sexy cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
Youve always kept out of mine  
I wonder whats on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe thats why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didnt see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasnt for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
Youre my entire supply of gas the match and igniter  
The only way that Im able to stay so stable  
Is youre the legs to my table  
If you were to break Id fall on my face  
But Im always gonna make you feel  
I dont need you as much as I really need you  
So you dont use it to your advantage  
But youre essential to me  
Youre the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
Id probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my   
Youre the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my   
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that Im lookin for  
When Im tryin to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just wont come to my mind  
Youre like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
Youre like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy crazy on you oh


You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
Its funny how Ive got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I aint got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
 day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look whos laughing  
Im sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart  
Jme on my chain  
Money on my head  
So it stays on my brain  
Till it turns me insane  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
But I dont wanna spend my whole life sleeping in bed  
Im tryna make a dream come to life  
Ill sleep when Im dead  
Time to get down  
Tie my lace up  
Cos Im about to chase some paper  
And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when Im all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
Im talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now its a brand new day  
And Ill be doin it again  
Its time for the main attraction  
  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream


Fuck an intro man lets go  
I come around like what goes around.  
What goes up must come down.  
Anyone who comes up must go down.  
Might as well go for the gusto now.

Last shot give it all you got.  
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob  
Fuck all you snobs.  
Hoes I hope all you rot.

And you wanna manage a trois you twots

Get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall.  
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum yall aint nothtin but a whole lot of suckin
goin on in rap.  
Yeah but Im home.  
Bad to the bone back in the zone  
Let him alone  
You dont wanna go eggin him on.  
  
Itll never be my chair that youre on.  
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen.  
Otherwords theres no heir to the throne.  
When I die so does hip hop.  
Hitchcock better shit bitch ass gotgot a zip locked in a bag.  
You fags aint been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.  
Keep blogging while Im mind boggling my zone like Im in the twilight dog
get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.  
  
Flow so wet Ima take this beat tobogganin.  
Im water logging it Im sogging it.  
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.  
Suplexin it on cement like Im on some straight outta compton shit  
Take this dick and chomp on it.  
Im so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment.  
Jackass eat a donkey dick.  
The game I just about conquered it like Donkey Kong  
Im bonkers bitch Im the king of this honkey shit I reign supreme in this
honkey shit.  
No sense screaming and arguing.  
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.  
You think you ball well I palm it.  
I throw up bombs when I vomit.  
Boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelet.  
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.  
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.  
Bitch Im as bat shit as Ozzy its obvious you can tell I go right off the
bat.  
No pun intended but come any closer Ill bite off your head.  
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web Im just gonna
spin it and try to use it to my advantage.  
I catch a fly in that bitch.  
You think you fly you just food.  
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude.  
Guess I just do what you cant do or make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too  
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck outta hells
kitchen  
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken.  
Yeah its Shady slut the rest can suck on a big one.  
Cause Im despicable as daffy duck when Im spitting.  
Haha recovery


  
Oh all around the World  
Theres an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
  
Royce  
Classical palms  
Battle my own demons  
I need a glass of Patron  
Bad as I need a horn  
Stabbing my clavicle bone  
Im at it or prone  
First time I seen a dessert eagle  
I was letting the  buss  
The  pop  
First time you seen one you was eating coco puffs  
Looking at Robocop  
Im not a man Im a logo Im sustain  
In order to clean my things you need saline  
Im never refering to the solution  
Im talking about more like the mustang  
Vroom  
Get respect from the getgo hello  
Set to the echo pyscho  
Pen got a mind of its own gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise  
Ill probably vibe out to a nine minute song  
As the echo follows the Maserati  
As the petrol swallows  
Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton  
Check your bible inside it it will say this guys an elephant  
Im fly like Im killing the scene like Im a villain with wings  
Ill sleep when Im  feet deep  
Right now Im living a dream  
Though we may be reckless  
The ladies check us  
They whisper Shady records  
Baby echo  
  
  
Oh all around the World  
Theres an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
  
  
I can hear them calling calling calling calling calling  
I eat rappers with the rhyme consume em  
The only fcking thing that you consume is time

Its too complex girl you assuming cupids looming  
My mentalitys caveman stupid woman  
My life is Truman show all I have is music hoe  
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago  
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow  
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think Imma lay here just spooning yo  
Oh you think you the shit cause I just said you was beautiful  
Diabolical till the last molecule down to my last hair folicle and cuticle  
Rhyming to the call to the  all the way down to my sock and the hair on my
toe  
Learn how to sew so shut my own booty hole  
Cause I aint took no sht since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first
pubic grow  
I told these stupid hoes when I come back Imma set this bitch on fire  
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her  
Cause this time muthafckers Im put my whole Goddamn dick inside her  
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet  
Ima go get tip and try to rip it wider  
  
  
Oh all around the World

And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise

Hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking

Ive been kickin ass off bullshit  
Throwaway rhymes pick a batch  
I live for the love of rap you crazy  
Ive made beats for JayZ for free  
Page me you need a beat you Cannabis  
Then its Dres fee you Kay Slay the fees waved  
I stay beefin with jd till the day Dre ways me  
That its okay to stop blazin him  
Oops I put it out I apologize now  
Its too late G its on tape  
And the tape leaped "Say What You Say" mothafucka  
Drama King Kay Slay mothafucka We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka  
zibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka


Met a retarted kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg  
Go to bed with a keg wake up with a forty  
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula D  
Forget an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas  
Cross the bombest  
We blowing up your house  
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas  
Im as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today yesterday  
And the day before Sabateur  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure


Lord please forgive for what I do  
For I know not what Ive done.  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
But mama dont want me the next thing I know Im gettin dropped off  
getting dropped off

getting dropped off  
Ring ring ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front
porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
But they didnt want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Til someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary theyd gang up on me and sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just dont understand understand  
And by the way wheres my dad  
  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately predominately everythings always predominately  
Predominatelywhite predominatelyblack well what about me  
Where does that leave me  
Well I guess that Im between predominately both of em  
I think if I hear that fuckin word again Im a scream  
While Im projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you  
Do you think that Im kidding  
What do I look like some kinda idiot  
Wait a minute shit dont answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
Its such Bullshit its tush mull bish  
Woe is me there goes poor  again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow hes always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his exwife how they go at it man  
Id hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it I cant imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it  
Shit if you only knew the half of it  
  
  
  
Evil deeds while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I dont wanna be Satans spawn never got the chance to say Im sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear SantaClause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this  
Everything could have been So perfect but life aint a fairy tale.  
Im about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me theres people everywhere  
I dont even know but who feel like they know me cause Im in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merrygoround  
Here we go now dosido now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ringaroundtherosie the shows over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just dont close for me  
This aint how fame was supposed to be  
Wheres the switch I can just turn offandon this aint what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
Til I pass  back the baton the cameras on my soul is gone  
  
  
  
Ooh  
Last one baby  
Lets Go  
Detroit


Risin up back on the street  
Did my time took my chances  
Went the distance now Im back on my feet

Dont lose your grip on the dreams of the past

Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor

In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above  
I want this hand in its rightful glove  
Have people saying god damn shes fine  
Me responding with damn right shes mine  
Even though your gone I try and carry on  
Its sad but its true me and you  
Were through  
But people still think they know us and they dont know shit  
But I want you to know Im sorry and I still love you britt  
But now Ive come to see our destiny will never fit  
And thats why now I look back being once lost then found  
Its getting tougher with you not around  
Your the only thing that got me to smile  
I guess our love was a truthful denile  
Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought yea but people act like its a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But its sad cause the image I portray the pieces dont fit  
All this time how could it be my destiny will never be you and me  
But I wish people could see how much Im so crazy  
In love with you its true I wish it was still me and you  
Doin what we use to do I wish they really knew  
And I wish theyd know Id never let anything bad happend to you  
I got your back to the fullest baby nems one to stay truest  
But times were tough and shit got rough  
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought  
But just know britt my rhymes are true  
Britt please know Ill forever Love you  
It just sucks cause theres a few out there that got Nems back  
People always tellin me get your fuckin life on track  
But in order to do that I need you back  
And thats why you dont know what you got till its gone  
Im so sorry that our love was always off and on.

Here it go  
See this is the part I was worried about  
Everybody thinks that my career was down the tubes  
And I must be in some dusty garage  
Inhalin the carbon monoxide fumes  
And everyones tellin me what I should do and how I should come out or what
to rap about  
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out  
And Im not sure how this is gonna come off  
Theyre probably gonna think that Im comin off as cocky  
Like I just started givin a fuck what you really think about me worship  
See the thing about me is you dont really know a thing about me  
Everyones makin a stink about me  
Like its some kind of a aura of that up that came around me  
Surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers


What would it take to push a man  
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life  
What would drive someone completely over the edge  
To do some shit like that the green and gold.  
  
I done filled my lungs up  
With so much of this crack smoke  
My necks bloated my techs loaded  
Im flat broke and Im pissed off  
Mad at the world Ive had it with girls  
And Im frustrated ran to the bus stop  
Just made it and hopped on  
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on  
I spot JOHN a white collar worker  
In clean cut walked up to em  
He was like what whatchu mean what you know what time it is man  
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.  
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen  
A man holdin a nine and then  
Shot him from the bottom up  
Stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck  
Hopped out to flee on my feet  
Fucked around forgot that I left my ID on the seat

And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress  
Coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh  
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis  
Im so bananas Im showin up to your open casket  
To fill it full of explosive gasses

Blow you to fragments

Repeat x

But if were hellbound whatever lets go down  
  
JBlack

Leave the E.R. then hit a bar for a liquor shot til the liver spot  
 day we all gon die  
But when I die Ima be so high  
That Ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare  
With the chalk outline still there  
I smoke til I choke and I sex a lot  
I got a cross on my chain but its just a rock  
Now if I pray every night night  
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight  
You feel me God I done did so much shit while on Earth  
I smoke I drink I curse and to make matters worse  
I bust my gun first and then I chat with your corpse  
Since way back I was one to never like backtalk  
See me at the pearly gates in line wearin a Nordface  
Nickel nine at my waist God done lost faith  
Angels greet me but I dont reply back  
Just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres Thai at  
  
  
  
Masta Ace  
Analyze the strength of my game like Lee Corso  
Call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso  
And of course yo yall know Im no stranger to danger  
Like Christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger  
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound  
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds  
My pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger  
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her  
Ten blocks untie the bitch and I still bag her  
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager  
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel  
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel  
Everyday I grow more older and more colder  
Fly you to Colorado roll you over with a Boulder  
I know you want to retaliate but you wont dare  
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care  
  
Repeat x  
  
But every time I take a step it gets dim tell me is this hell were livin in

Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin go crack

Wrap me in a bolt of lightning  
Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe thats the way I should go  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought Id be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way  
  
  
  
I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
Im writing to you cuz Im hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents dont care that I do this shit  
No one loves me its like  
Im a piece of trash  
I dont get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you dont reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way  
  
  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason dont you forget that  
Pulled whats the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
Its just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all its doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead whats the point in all this  
  
I finally put it all together  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe thats the way it should be  
You know Ive led my life like a gypsy  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way

Check it out  
  
Hey Kyu  
  
  
Its a broke day but everything is OK Its OK  
Im up all night but everything is alright Its alright  
Its a rough week and I dont get enough sleep I cant sleep  
Its a long year pretending I belong here Belong here  
  
 day I plan to be a family man happily married  
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried  
Til Im glad to be buried  
And leave this crazy world  
  
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl  
It may be early to be planning this stuff  
Cause Im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough  
Cause man its been rough but still I manage enough  
  
Ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed  
My hands have been cuffed  
But I dont panic and huff frantic and puff  
Or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts  
  
Im anteing up double or nothing Ive been trouble enough  
And Im sick of struggling and suffering see  
My destinys to rest at ease till Im impressed and pleased  
With my progress I wont settle for less than cheese  
  
Im on a quest to seize all my own label to call  
Way before my baby is able to crawl  
Im too stable to fall the pressure motivates  
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades  
  
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth  
Where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf Kyu  
  
  
  
Im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps  
Everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep  
Praying for sleep  
Dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
In this slaughtering house caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
Ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grants and Jacksons  
These transactions explain a mans actions  
But in the mist of this insanity I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and theres a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brothers trying to learn his mathematics  
Hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
Im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
Its cumbersome Im trying to do well on this Earth  
But its been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth  
  
  
  
Uh its OK yeah its alright even though I cant sleep  
Uh yeah its OK its alright I cant sleep

Look  
If you had  
 shot  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy  
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti  
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin  
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out  
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now  
The clocks run out times up over blaow  
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity  
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked  
Hes so mad but he wont give up that easy No  
He wont have it he knows his whole back citys ropes  
It dont matter hes dope he knows that but hes broke  
Hes so stacked that he knows when he goes back to his mobile home thats
when its  
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him  
  
  
You better lose yourself in the music the moment  
You own it you better never let it go  
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king as we move toward a new world order  
A normal life is borin but super stardoms close to post mortar  
It only grows harder only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose its old partna but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
  
  
No more games Im a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cipher  
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to  
 and I cant provide the right type of  
Life for my family cause man these God damn food stamps dont buy diapers  
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And its getting even harder tryin to feed and water my seed plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a primadonna  
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not  
Mom I love you but this trail has got to go I cannot grow old in Salems
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got  
  
  
  
You can do anything you set your mind to man


A distant alarm a sound from far away  
We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker  
"This is not a drill I repeat this is not a drill"  
  
Today we die today we testify  
All we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving turning people into beasts  
Theyre feasting on eachother strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open dust is descending  
Breath the black air feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence  nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die today we testify  
All we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm


Obie Trice  
You dont see me in the hood its cause Im doing this man  
  
Niggas Im still grinding yeah I still hearing those sirens  
Im still getting chased by those lights  
Only the lights lime and my mics on  
And my time is none because Im writing more  
I dont hear to meet a soul in this business  
Im here to eat speak until these hos feel this  
I aint gonna let you derail me man  
I got Young Kobe homey you gotta let go of Obie  
Cause Obie be back going nowhere man we got them craps going on  
And that yak going on soon as a nigga touch down back from town

I want to hold you in the morn hold you thorough the night  
Right we want to love alcohol we want to love guns we want to love money  
we dont love no bitches though  
I just want to love for the rest of my life  
I want to hold you in the morn hold you in the night  
  
  
Theres a certain mystique when I speak that you notice  
Cause its sort of unique cause you know its me  
My poetrys deep and Im stillmatic the way I flow to this beat  
You cant sit still its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep  
Im strapped its known any minute I could snap  
Im the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped  
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically  
It aint even funny I aint even hungry it aint even money  
You cant pay me enough for you to play me  
Its cockamamie you just aint zany enough to rock with Shady  
My noodle is cockadoodle my clocks coocoo  
I got screws loose yea the whole kit and caboodle Im just brutal  
Its no rumor Im numero uno assume it theres no more humor in it you

Im rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag  
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass you better love me bitch  
  
  
  
 Cent  
My buzz is crazy in the hood they holla my name  
If it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain  
If I was you Id love men too I roll like a boss  
 eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce  
I aint gon front I thought R. Kelly was the shit  
Let me find out he fucking round with Bow Wow bitch  
Niggas eating popcorn right rewinding the tape  
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape  
Im convinced man something really wrong with these hos  
I thought Lil Kim was hot til she start fucking with her nose  
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill and tap my feet  
Then the bitch put out a CD and didnt have no beats  
That nigga DAngelo he determined not to fail  
That nigga went buttass for his record to sell  
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes  
And Big Ben taught Charlie B More to deep throat yea  
  
  
  
 Cent  
I love the burners the money the bunnies I just want to hold you ha ha  
I just want to love you yea


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I cant tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe  
I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
Its like Im huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before Im about to drown  
She resuscitates me she fucking hates me  
And I love it wait  
Where you going Im leaving you  
No you aint come back  
Were running right back here we go again  
Its so insane cause when its going good its going great  
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane  
But when its bad its awful  
I feel so ashamed I snapped whos that dude  
I dont even know his name I laid hands on her  
Ill never stoop so low again I guess I dont know my own strength  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
You ever love somebody so much  
You can barely breathe when youre with them you meet  
And neither one of you even know what hit em  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get em  
Now youre getting fucking sick of looking at em  
You swore youve never hit em never do nothing to hurt em  
Now youre in each others face  
Spewing venom and these words when you spit em  
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em  
Throw em down pin em so lost in the moments when youre in em  
Its the rage thats the culprit it controls you both  
So they say its best to go your separate ways  
Guess that they dont know ya cause today that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over its a different day  
Sound like broken records playin over but you promised her  
Next time youll show restraint  
You dont get another chance  
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave  
Out the window guess thats why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things did things  
That we didnt mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine but your tempers just as bad as mine is  
Youre the same as me but when it comes to love youre just as blinded  
Baby please come back it wasnt you  
Baby it was me maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems  
Maybe thats what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much to walk away now  
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk  
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball  
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know its lies  
Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
Im a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie


Maxine  
  
Hello  
Can I speak to Maxine  
Yeah this is me whats up  
What up  
  
Who dis  
Denaun  
Yeah whats up  
What are you doing  
  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Huh  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Why  
  
I dont know thinking about something freaky to do  
  
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine  
She tests positive but tells you that her acts clean  
Plus she got a sugar daddy  
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly on her reputation  
Youre in jepordation if you aint got no preparation  
When you step away son she got her face done  
Looking provocative shell let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price otherwise she wont look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Dont bring your germs to me cause I aint trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it Maxine  
  
Sometimes I wonder whats your purpose In life that is  
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit  
You living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
You say its gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this  
Mystery whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..  
Havent I seen you before" looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said "Oh its like that"  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation thats when she asked me could I fuck  
I said "Maxine check this out  
Give me your address Ill be through and youll find out"  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didnt waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said "Hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing"  
  
So I went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
" dont get mad but theres something that I gotta tell your ass"  
I said "What is it another nigga Its ok"  
She said "No I forgot to tell you that I got AIDS"  
I got up out  
  
Hey Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price What you mean  
You know money nigga  
You dont need no damn money  
I cant give you no money anyways I heard you got some shit.  
  
What you what you hear I got  
AIDS

Well if thats the case Kyu got it then  
Oh for real its like that

I aint fucking around with no rd nigga

It doesnt take much  
For me to raise such a stink up  
When motherfuckers hate your guts  
You aint even gotta say much  
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers  
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush  
I cant explain what it is my brain does  
But however it works its insane  
Its plain nutz  
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous  
Its a whole combination of things  
It takes nutz  
And Im not affriad to raise the stakes up  
I got a million bucks in the banks and  trucks  
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us  
Im patiently waiting for the day  
Im anxious  
To see the look on ya fake mugs  
When you thugs go bankrupt  
Ya drunk

Its too late chump now face up  
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and  musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause Ive always came off  
Like jas chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I dont stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I dont gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause Ive been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just aint ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since  mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls  
Trust me

Female Medic

Male Medic  
Ok got it on      
Hulets move


  
"All I see is blood and murder my mind state"  
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate"  
"All I see is blood and murder my mind state"  
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill  
  
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands heres yo life span  
And for what yo lifes worth this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
Im thirsty for this green so bad Im dehydratin  
Hurry up with the cash bitch I got a ride waitin  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin  
I want the whole pie I wont be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars aint enough to water the seed the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasnt nothin for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"  
But Im already wanted for sellin Kis  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest  
  
  
  
Left the house pullin out the drive backin out  
We were backin out this ladys Jag started blackin out  
Pulled the Mac out stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin mouth  
fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair smacked her up  
Thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up  
Stole her car made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on "Set it Off" did  
Jetted off kid stole the whip now Im a criminal  
Drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but Im injured badly though  
Parents screamin "Son go in and call the police  
Tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eightyyear old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese eggs milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up Im surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin "truce truce"  
Dont shoot Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasnt me  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps  
  



Yo yeah girl  
Can you hear that Its playing our song  
Are you sleepy Take a nap  
Youre not afraid of the dark Are you  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakotas door its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back with binoculars not cause I wanna peep  
But because Im hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums oh look here comes  hes on your street  
Hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on em hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am  
  
  
My music box  
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box  
But I can hear you my love you keep calling me My music box  
And when were worlds apart you mean the world to me My music box  
If you call Ill come I will answer My music box  
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box  
I hear my music box playing a song for me My music box  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box  
Wont you be my private little dancer My music box  
  
I almost look comatose who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mothers make up get naked and run around  
Wavin the gun around I think Im down to a hundred pounds  
Theres thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out  
I must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about  
Voices are leading me up to the attic I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest but what do I do its locked  
I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full I smell a funeral guess Ill loom in the park  
  
  
  
Im fixated on asphyxiating and breakin this little chicks  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin bitches get horsewhippins  
Im in the back through the back door slip in  
Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin  
The mortician of love sent from above  
Forced and treat em all  stingy Ive become  
Been doin this for more than a quarter century Im just numb  
Am I dreamin is it real Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder  
Id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that Ill have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments backtoback like Tabatha  
Im your secret admirer Im back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin her  
Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera  
Stand back cause here comes your man Jack so Pamela  
  



Yea oh oh yea yea oh  
  
I feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing  
  
I smell something in the air thats making me high  
I said I smell something in the air thats making me high  
  
Ok here we go doremifaso Im so ladida so  
Lyrical rise flow give back the tobasco  
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs  
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos  
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole  
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto  
Knives strangling wives with pig lasso  
Few bags of the the grass zig zags Im with the doc so  
You know how that go skull and the crossbones  
This is poison the boys and girls who do not know  
You do not want to try this at home my novato novice  
This is niether the time or the place to get macho  
So crack a six pack sit back with some nachos  
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow  
Its not what you expected tho what you thought though  
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke  
  
  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers gotten into me I dont mind  
  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers got into me I dont mind  
  
Your dreams of getting the pill you are literally getting the chills  
Spitting at will me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill  
Youre submitting to skill sitting still Im admitting Im beginning to
feel  
Like I dont think anyones real  
Faced with a dilemma I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please dont upset me mama you lookin sexy mama  
Dont know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Dont want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped  
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in  
And how they attacked the victim  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one  
Which night it was done what kid would write there was none  
So sloppy like this its fun the fuckin ecstasy goes  
  
  
  
When Im behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that youre trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre legends are made this way  
Isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some  
He can give her some she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
Youre spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance Im  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain thats full of surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening this aint even a weed thing  
I aint even smoke anything I aint even drink anything  
  



Daddy what are you doing  
Okay then  
Everybody listen up  
Im goin to hell  
Whos comin with me  
Somebody please help him  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Theres no mountain I cant climb theres no tower too high  
No plane that I cant learn how to fly  
What do I gotta do to get through to you  
To show you there aint nothin I cant take this chainsaw to  
Fuckin brains brawn and brass balls I cutem off  
And gotem pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall  
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton Johns name on my drag wall  
Im out the closet Ive been lyin my ass off  
All this time me and Dre been fuckin with hats off Suck it .  
So tell Laura and her husband to back off  
Before I push this motherfuckin button and blast off  
And launch one at these Russians and thats all  
Blow every fuckin thing except Afghanistan on the map off.  
When will it stop When will I knock the crap off  
Hailie tell em baby  
My Dads Lost It  
  
  
Theres really nothin else to say I I cant explain it  
I think my dads gone crazy  
A little help from Hailie Jade wont you tell em baby  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres no one on earth that can save me not even Hailie  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Its like my mother always told me and codeine and  
Goddammit you little motherfucker  
If you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin  
Uh fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin dick  
Chew on a prick and lick  
A million mutherfuckin cocks per second  
Id rather put out a mutherfuckin Gospel record  
Id rather be a pussy whipped bitch eat pussy  
And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin my flows  
Quit givin me my ammo. Cant you see why Im so mean  
If yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my M.O.  
I wouldnt have to go eenee meenee meini mo  
Catch a homo by his toe man I dont know no more  
Am I the only fuckin one whos normal any more  
Dad  
  
  
  
My songs can make you cry take you by surprise at the same time  
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what youre seein is a genius at work which to me isnt work  
So its easy to misinterpret it at first  
Cause when I speak its tongueincheek  
Id yank my fuckin teeth before Id ever bite my tongue  
Id slice my gums get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ices son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on.  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade standin on Ronnies grave  
Screamin at the sky til clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And thats pretty much the gist of it the parents are pissed but the kids
love it.  
 millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers

We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up  a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
 tattoos one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous

You shortminded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

Colin Powells Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy bitch I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip who you going home with
How Ye doing I’m surviving

Where the bad bitches huh Where you hiding
I got the power to make your life so exciting

Dinner with Anna Wintour racing with Anja Rubik

In the projects one day to Project Runway
We done heard all that loudass talking were used to it

To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me then you do it
We flyer than a parakeet floatin with no parachute
 thousand dollar pair of shoes we made it to the Paris news
Dont talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me fore I embarrass you

And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And Ill admit I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well thats cool baby girl do ya thang
Lucky I aint had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia Roc Nation
We in the building we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet floatin with no parachute
 thousand dollar pair of shoes I made it to the Paris news
Dont talk about style cause Ill embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me fore I embarrass you
GOOD Music we fresh we fresh
Anything else we detest detest
Bitchass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said let me ask this question

I believe theres a God above me
Im just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow" fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’ when Puff woulda had Shyne with him yuugh
Matchin Daytonas rose gold on us
Goin H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it Ima pour more
Well if you goin coupe I’m goin four door

Hold up I aint trying to stunt man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess thats a feeling only me and Lebron know
Im living three dreams Biggie Smalls Dr. King
Rodney Kings uhh cause
Cause we cant get along  no resolution
Til we drown all these haters rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aww man you sold your soul
Naww man mad people was frontin
Aww man made somethin from nothin
Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the 
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
 killings in a weekend  killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say
"Im on fire ay" thats what Richard Pryor say
And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye

Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon act phony or who gone try to embarrass ya
Imma need a day off I think Ill call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Cause I’m richer and prior to this shit was moving free base
Had a conference with the DJs Puerto Rico three days
Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I’m in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had they shut down Prive
Ain’t that where the Heat play Niggas hate ballas these days Yep
Ain’t that like Lebron James Ain’t that just like D. Wade Wait

On a bathroom wall I wrote
"Id rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said "Yeezy I aint your right girl"
Youll probably find one of them "I like art"type girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

"Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"  Chloe Mitchell

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said "What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves"
What if Mary "What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

See before I let you go
 last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
 times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started  hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then

Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God


Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave

Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah

I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago

DJs need to listen to the models
"You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato"
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know

And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise

Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with  rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it

Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
And what’s a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it
You blowin up that’s good fantastic
That y’all its like that yall
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls

Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm

May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians

What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess it’s rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I’m looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime

When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don’t leave while youre hot that’s how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme

I need that happy beginnin middle and endin
Chicago St. Louis St. Louis to Chicago
Its gettin hot in here thats all that I know
Got a hotel room  stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl its  in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House girl dont start with me
I used the Western Union for you like its no prob
Cause you was in college complainin about its no jobs
But you were suckin a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjobs better than no job

This the crayist shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
Its so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguards back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club"
If not treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again

I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr. HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man

What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God Driver  wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe safe
My dawgs couldnt tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised
Theres been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up Im a grownass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But Im a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music thats fire spit my soul through the wire

Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary Im the boss tonight
And you dont give a fuck what they all say right
Awesome the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn they dont make em like this anymore
I ask ‘cause Im not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go apeshit
Specially in my Pastel on my Bape shit
Act like you cant tell who made this
New Gospel homie take six and take this haters

I dont know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
Im trippin this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
Theres a thousand yous theres only one of me
Im trippin Im caught up in the moment right
‘Cause its Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon do everything that Kan like
Heard theyd do anything for a Klondike
Well Id do anything for a blonde dyke
And shell do anything for the limelight
And well do anything when the times right
Uh baby youre makin it
Harder better faster stronger

Damn baby pussy cant be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically Russell aint the only Russell
Russell Brand Russell Crowe
    a whole lot of Os
What you after actor money
You in line behind currency yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom when Im in these hoes
Got staples on my dick why Fuckin centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on feelin like Jerome
She got her fur too we got our his and her on
Dont look at the jewelry or get your burrr on
Too close you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back you overclose
Oh no the hood was strugglin
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and Im cold bitch please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like "love to start shit"
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy"
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my  seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me  seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him  ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked  people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god is that a black card"
I turned around and replied "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips

I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
‘Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me"

But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said "You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown

It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove
Im in the twodoor true that niggas telling me "You back"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it you talk it I live it
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
No paper ho but you can have some more of me
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H·A·M nigga
Me and Jigga
And a nigga still young thats why I have no kids
But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H·A·M

I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing

Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah

My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past 

Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout "how my neck look"
Well it all looks great
 hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
 set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
 set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave  to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow

Closed eyes see things

They dont want nothin
You mothafuckas livin like half of your level half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto I aint gon lie
We be in the bathroom fuckin like "Baby dont get too loud"

Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us

I know I know I shouldn’t even bother
With all these gossiping nopussygetting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham I need another costume
PETAs mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman

Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urrr that they killed Pac in
Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up hands up then the cops shot us

You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace
And next these niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* its kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be askin us questions harass and arrest us
Sayin "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move
I hope

To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the scrippers
Jesus walks for them
To the victims of welfare for we livin in Hell here hell yeah
Jesus walks for them
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we dont think
I aint here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out

Wake up Mr. West Mr. West
Mr. Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
I mean damn did you even see the test
You got Ds muthafucka Ds Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation

Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm  buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang

Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student
Some people graduate but be still stupid
They tell you read this eat this dont look around
Just peep this preachers teach us Jesus
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
After all of that you received this

Im the one baby yeah Im the one baby
Since God gave his only begotten son baby
Its hard preachin the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums baby
You on a run baby you on a run baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds baby
You think you me but you aint me what you done lately
Mhm thats cool but I been runnin on the sun baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson Jackson Jordan  Michael Phelps
Yeahhh had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip  Yeeeaaaalmmp

Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Wont even get pulled over in they new V
The good life lets go on a living spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A. it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y. summertime Chi
Ah Now throw yo hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Yall pop the trunk I pop the hood Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass I got to look sorry

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who aint on TV
Cause they got mo ass than the models
The good life so keep it comin with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ay this is the good life Welcome to the good life
Homey tell me whats good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood Welcome to the good life
Like Im new in the hood
The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could
But but I dont think he should Welcome to the good life
 told me go head switch the style up
And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team; I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line "Dawg in due time"
Now he look at me like "Damn dawg You where I am"
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident ‘cause this must be Heaven

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man these niggas that much better than me"
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name "Porscha" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because

I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
 minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is  years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
A&Rs lookin like "Pssh we messed up"
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo where Dame at"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of  she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least  or  times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout; picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out "Jigga"
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind "He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint 
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say "Damn Oh thats you"
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin S.O.B.s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like "Yeah yeah we gon be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now Im on the steeple
And we know "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like "Damn no way"
Translate espanol "No way Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse

And I’ll never let my son have an ego
He’ll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I’ll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I’ll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin’ and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Don’t want him to be hated all the time judged
Don’t be like your daddy that would never budge
And I’ll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that ain’t the place to get love
And I’ll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure now we all pray

I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heaven’s sakes huh
Well I’mma levitate make the devil wait yeah

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang

 day I’m gon marry a porn star
We’ll have a bigass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldn’t rent her they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on

Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back" Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
"Ease up there baby boy" Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
 years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama

Forrest Gump mama said "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama

And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars  I know it

They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up

We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like "No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say "How is work baby"
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote "Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."
On the phone hollin that "niggas is whatever"
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor "Just drive so far."
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely

How could you be so Dr. Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up  AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me

You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say "when you see clothes close your eyelids" realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie  I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe

When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible

I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle

Ill never be pictureperfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am

And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the "Nigga Please" Award
But Ill just take the "I Got a Lot of Cheese" Award

I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over  caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr. West please no more today

You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way

Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
"Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial"
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on
Said he couldnt rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone

Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me "Benz or Rover"
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said "Sorry Mr. West is gone"

I told my mama I was on the come up
She said "You going to school I’ll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin’
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain’t no fashion show mothafucka we live it

Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means

And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
 oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if you’ll ever find your dreams

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the "No Smokin" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing  beats a day for  summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach"
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship

Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool We assholes
Thats why we hear your music in fast forward
Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo

Nnnnnnow who the hell is this
Emailing me at 
Telling me that she  plus doubled
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
WHITE its getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet so you got to "call me"
And bring a friend for my friend his name Kweli
You mean Talib Lyrics sticks to your rib
I mean Thats my favorite CD that I play at my crib
I mean You dont really know him why is you lyin
Yo Kwe she dont believe me please pick up the line
She gon think that Im lyin just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe Ill be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high

I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir Chanel Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls

Jessica Gomes yall I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve

Coco Rocha Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too I’m a freak boo
I’m wilding I’m on a thousand

If this is your first time hearin this
You are about to experience somethin so cold man
We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man
Man you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say "next summer Im finna"
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown

The second verse is for my dogs workin  to  that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off $.
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And "we dont care what people say"

You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite  Cent song " Questions"
We scream "rocks blow weed park" see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But "we dont care what people say"
My niggas

This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man "This Cant Be Life"
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business

This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture
Abi remember when they aint believe in me
Now she like "See thats my cousin on TV"
Now we gettin it and we gon make it
And they gon hate it and Im his favorite
I cant deny it Im a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin
Grandma get em shook up
Aw naw dont open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that cant remember your name
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit  in the bed if its  of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business

Yeah uh now I’ma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
I’m Socrates but my skin more chocolatey
What’s up with who That’s old news
I’m in a speedboat in my boat shoes
Hah I swear my whole collection’s so cruise
I might walk in Nobu wit no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy I told you"
Immature adult insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete that’s your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan beat that’s your last fault
Get what you ask for I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty but she couldn’t drop that ass low
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
When you gettin money cops don’t let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail yo in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer tell em I said "Hello"
Ask if I’ma be there soon and tell him I said “Hell no”
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh

Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch; wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre lookin for fossils
Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip’s on the Sprewells it’s so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic; 
Lyrically can’t none of y’all murder ‘Ye
Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona. Im zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
 years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory

What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
 doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit

I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me uh for the followin’
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin’
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing ’cause when you chase the pussy it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap it’s a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
 of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin  he was stuntin
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
 of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie

I do it for the forefathers yeah the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man’s sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will
If I don’t make it can’t take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they don’t know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it’s not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild
You aint get the memo Yeezy’s back in style
Now one room got Gidget the other got Bridget
What’s more tripped out dawg is they sisters
Nah you aint listen they black they sistas
They momma named them after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Stupid questions like “Is he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him”
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life’s cursed well mine’s an obscenity

 and  and  and  and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed
Its a party tonight and ooh shes so excited
Tell me whos invited you your friends and my dick
Whats scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss I forgot your name
Thank you God bless you good night I came I came I came

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on  bars
We aint sweating to the oldies
We juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl
 and you brought  friends
OK  more now hop in the Benz
door  do you know the difference between a    
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers gangstas all us ballas

Pray for me
Im about to hit the Ye button
I dont wanna say nothin wrong
But itd be wrong if I aint say nothin
Imagine if I aint say somethin
Wouldnt none these niggas say nothin
I done lost and made money
Now Im makin somethin they cant take from me
And Im fresh out of debt in this mothafucka
And they still aint ready yet for a mothafucka
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
Im bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

Im not loving you way I wanted to
What I had to do had to run from you
Im in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know never never know
Never know enough til its over love
Til we lose control SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming "No no no nnooo"
Im not loving you way I wanted to
See I wanna move but cant escape from you
So I keep it low keep a secret code
So everybody else dont have to know

Im not loving you way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I got something to lose so I gotta move
I cant keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through
You lose you lose
Im not loving you the way I wanted to
See I had to go see I had to move
No more wasting time you cant wait for life
Were just racing time wheres the finish line

Im not loving you way I wanted to
I bet no one knew I got no one new
Know I said Im through but got love for you
But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll only God knows
If I be with you baby Im confused
You choose you choose
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Where I wanna go I dont need you
Ive been down this road too many times before
Im not loving you way I wanted to

Primetime basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime coloring out of the line
Cause they dont want nobody thats colored out of the lines
So Im late as a motherfucker colored people time

Niggas gonna kill me I swear they better be lying

Im tripping on it socks on marble floors Im slipping on it
Champagne Im sipping on shit tastes different dont it
You know what You right

"When you coming home" Thats a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
I mean who says shit like that and doesnt laugh
Hah

Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter thats what I call karma
And you pray to God she dont grow breasts too soon
Projects to up gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off thats how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He aint never had shit but he had that 
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put  and  together and a little bad weather
Gon be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool

So they ask me  why you call it Late Registration Ye
Cause we takin these muhfuckers back to school
If you know this part right here feel free to sing along

I know its past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures
He claim her heart cant take the anaesthesia
Itll send her body into a seizure
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Hey chick Im at a loss for words
What do you say at this time Remember when I was 
Tell her everything gon be fine but I be lyin
Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
Im arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandmas in the NBA
Right now shed be okay But since she
Was just a secretary worked for the church for  years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together hes strong
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research"
She asked me "Can you sign some tshirts"
Bitch is you smokin reefer
You dont see that we hurt But still

They outside of the emergency room room
You can feel my heartbeat beat beat
If she gon pull through we gon find out soon
But right now she asleep sleep sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
Let me see the rays I aint no expert Im just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley Aunt Beverly Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie its just " Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a alltime high
To get there we run we fly we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers were the roses

Imma get on this TV mama
Imma Imma put shit down
Imma make sure these lightskinned niggas
Never ever never come back in style
Told em I finished school and I started my own business
They say "Oh you graduated" No I decided I was finished
Chasing yall dreams and what youve got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of our class
I went to Cheesecake he was a motherfucking waiter there

I got a Jones like Norah for your soror
Bring more of them girls Ive seen in The Aurora
Tammy Becky and Laura or a Shirley
Im trying to hit it early like Im in a hurry
See thats how dude became the young Pootie Tang "tippy tow"
Rocafella chain yeah thats my rapper style
Rosary piece yeah thats my Catholic style
Red and white s yeah thats my Kappa style
And I aint even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I aint even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over Im here for a reason

Whats your addiction Is it money Is it girls Is it weed
Ive been afflicted by not one not two but all three
Shes got the same thing about me but more about us
Shes coming over so I guess that means Im her drugs
Just let me peek now I mean damn Im so curious
Shes got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush
Times of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja Henny and CocaCola
Then Im co coming over cause its never over

I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blown
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go
Then Ill get the lotion and do somethin to me when your thighs is exposed
Theres no turning back now I mean I dont mean to impose
Not now but right now I need you to undress and then pose
Im into that now catch a vibe when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep co coming over cause its never over

Lift off lift off takin my coat off
Showing my tattoos Im such a show off huh
I feel the pain and then roll off
I got the whole city they about to go off
How many niggas with me up and in the aisle
How many people want to roll on me now
Like you know na na na you know me by now
Know me know me by now

Dude Fresh off the plane Konnichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it spit it then he shit it
I dont need writers I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport havent I this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But Im doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please how you gonna say I aint no Lohead
Cause my Dior got me more model head
Im insulted you should go head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top  MCs you aint gotta remind me
Top  MCs you gotta rewind me
Im high up on the line you could get behind me
But my heads so big you cant sit behind me

And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say "Motherfucker your mommas a bitch."
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its

And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying "You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be."
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh

Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong

My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club look at here what we got
Some drunk and hot girls
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

Cuffed up and hosed down pimped up and hod down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the tops

I told her to "drive over in your new whip bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring the Cool Whipthen I want you to strip
See you is my new chickso we get our grind on
She be grabbing calling me Biggie like Shyne home

Imma play this Vandross you gon take your pants off

Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I could make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All of the time

You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now youre here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Dont worry about what we cant control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry were closed

How we stop the Black Panthers
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that its like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Thats that good shit we aint sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man

From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood its a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that

You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been

Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh

Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh

Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again
And its still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is
Im tryin to spend my stacks
And Im so broke I look back like "Damn was I on crack"
I mean twelve platinum chains was I on that
What the hell was wrong with me dog
Sing along with me yall

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D. a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
And givin head is like a whale thats usin a toothpick
Well Im in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $free.
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it aint gon cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And Im still actin calm denamuhh
She asked "Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was"
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin off dont get no rich nigga
Give ME some head thatll really piss him off

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or til I go crash
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second Ill be there with my weapon
Pullin up in the Lexuses one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed drink and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And Imma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
You cant take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Stop all your blood clot cryin I was flyin
Made it to school with barely nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I dont wan be broke when Im 
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West theres no good classes and thats what yo ass get
Not even electives Not even prerequits
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds
Now Im in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muhfuckers underachievin
Man this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo
Like old folks pissin I guess it all depends oh oh
Stop your cryin baby

You know when you be late you miss all the lights
Thats right thats right thats right thats right
And when you get back she gon start up a fight
That night that night that night
Baby its too late for that lately Ive been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos what would you do for a Klondike
Or two dykes that look Christina Milianlike
Hm Ill be on time for that
I aint thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo Ill be there in five minutes five hours later
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Im so live with it look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah

We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say "Yo no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something

Such an easy morning we on a ride
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive

I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather wasn’t barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not

Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still wonderful night to be alive baby
And I’m so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall don’t trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is “Where my presents”
She said “Shhh” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well I like the way you think mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink mami
Youve been a bad girl give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate she said “It’s Deericious”

Why you actin all
Shy and all

"I never did this before"
Stop that
What you want some Patron
I got that
I mean I promise yall
You fine and all
And your girlfriend she kinda raw
But she not like you

Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off

See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said "daddy thats the reason why you had me"
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall

Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes

Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts. I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped

They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks

Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called "nigga"
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master "Peace"

I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I would’nt have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change so we’ll never agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
I’m spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I’ve been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
I’m not right dog I’m slightly off
I’m paranoid; like bonin’ raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea that’ll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I should’ve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin

You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said "I just cleaned up"
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt

Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team

He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like "Who this newer guy"
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out "I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room"

Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
"You gonna marry my mom" Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you

There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright. Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in  she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in  I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel

Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to call..one ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise

Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said "I know what you about to say like your hypeman"
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but

Roll some think I’ll roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the  baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don’t know why but I know a sign when I see it

Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the  inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like

My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me"
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown

Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says "is that HeSus"
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds

Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit
Why dont you buy some bigger tits
Something thatll last you
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I dont need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan

Thats why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them Ds

Thirsty what is you saying

Why the hell is Im worrying hopping out the Benz with the perfect 
"Man your life must be perfect man look at how they came up with the perfect plan"

You know I jumped out like Pacll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on logical
Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible

I wish all wack niggas’d get out the game
You can’t con me that’s half my name
And if you had any brains
You wouldn’t wanna lose half your brain
By hating on players in the game
Wack nigga the beat go “duh duh da”
And then yo flow go way the fuck off

Mayonnaise colored Benz I push Miracle Whips
But I’m not trying to cause commotion
And have my niggas bring all the toast in

“On the real in the street I got the good name

Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her nieces graduation man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater

She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend

Dont be acting like no actress if we preaching then we practice
Dont be reaching dont be touching shit
We in Kanye Wests Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

Uh Uh
Lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a New Balance before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you
Im as Chi as buckfiftys and Pelle Pelle Leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow served over over a billion
Youve seen the video words over the building
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked  MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with  seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line

Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more

It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be
I learned my lesson now I only fuck hoes thats close to me
Dont get me wrong you still gotta live close to me
This aint a song I made for ugly hoes to start approachin me

The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘rari six hundred horses that’s my chariot of fire
Where we flying they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it

Imma grab your waist then Imma grab your face and
Then Imma taste it then Imma blaze it

Whats your friends attitude why she so damn rude huh
Tell her smile for a change
If a baller come around she gone smile for the change
I know they type I know the life
I know youre living your life for the night another night
Ask the city what they got for us
That mean it wasnt even poppin if it not for us
Then isnt isnt this all that I said itd be
I want the best for you but want better for me ugh
I paid the price of fame icy chain
Stack my money tall height advantage

When I fight and you fight we dont fight fair
So I guess Ill see you in my nightmares
Just remember I made you like my Nike Air
YeYeezys please be easy
To kill the animosity thats in the air
Ill touch every curve of your body like a Herve Leger
And this wasnt no ordinary love
Our sex wasnt ordinary drugs
Its that crack that crystal meth
I mean it gets so wet I had to go in depth
I mean the bitch so fresh I had to go in debt
Rurunning my credit card til theres no more left
Uh but thats cool you wife and Ill be groom
I thought I had a sign a Seal like Heidi Klum
Like Jay and B
Like Chris and Ri
But this Christmas youll be missing me

Now once she go black she aint never coming back
Im sorry Mr. H I thought you already knew that
You will see her on a black street like Chauncey
Im a bad boy like Sean C
Rock a fella like Shawn C
Keep them Apes with me like Don C
Like Jay keep Beyonce
Im just talking nonsense so nonchalantly
See my Mark like Ronsy
Pop my collars like Fonzy
Paparazzi is on me
I see your girl want me Im filling up her glass
Feeling on her ass feeling so upper class
And your boy so fresh
I might even flash cash
So at the end of the night you aint even gotta ask

Im Yeezy she say "Hi Im Aria"
No you a angel you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea they built a new arena
Why dont you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before but dont know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now its something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool but dont let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress you take her to the cleaners
Sure enough a week later Im in extra love
And everybody know shes mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame dont get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a ena
She let it go to her head "No not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writers blocking me
I couldnt get my shit out anyway I hope you die Aria

We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running but where is you going
What is you smoking man That aint potent
What is you talking man That aint important
Illuminati High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it dont matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin relaxin shootin some pool and
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victorias Secret show they miss me
Voices in my head I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH get out my fucking head
Its just me and my bad bitch
So you can say Im on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia Im aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I dont really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon make it thats on everything
Truest girls get half naked every spring
They saying "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday"
Cause my verses got pain Chocolate Rain
So many lines you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. thats whats up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower fresh as fuck

How much they hate it very
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung but I Spring er Jerry
Don’t try this at home results may vary
King like T.I. but in the Chi Larry

We killing the game its not fair
You muthafuckers stay right there
Cause we too high up in the air

Nigga peeune peeune peeune

I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world
Of goldplated Earl cause
Everything I throw up blow up
Talking to the girl
She said "Know what grow up you nasty"
"I don’t understand why they trippin’ if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
 day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My my my whips is sidebyside
He just talkin mines outside
Do you mind if I
Take you on a test
Do you have allwheel drive
And if that baby purr Im gonna baby her
Bitches gon hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work
I know you was on purpur
But this is a whole new arena
See niggas come by talkin bout they make it rain

Is that yo girlfriend I really like her
Im talkin only for a night I wouldnt wife her
I got them Yeezys on my feet I got them Louies in the sto Want some
And I dropped another album fore we finished up the tour
And its still top  bout fifteen weeks later
So thats a middle finger for you  haters

I got my superman power my superman cape
These the last hours but superman late
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit

Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now
I dont even write down
I dont need her right now
But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the "B" got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa
Oh should have tucked your chain
Niggas aint playing man it aint a fuckin game
All that frontin for the audience
Make em not exist no more Yugoslavians

Ohhhhh ohhhh; ohhh you too much pressure doll
You gon raise my cholesterol
I gotta lower the phone decibels
Just to talk just a thought
Imma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like reservoir and I was Mr. Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way good way
Now we in the streets and Im chokin you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning Bossip Perez
Any girl I take out Mediatakeout I need a break now
Before I break now ah ah ah ah

You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson classy
Ohhh why she say that OUCH~
Bitch give me back my couch
On that same couch casting
Now listen to TPain and sing

When you take the picture cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the +MC Serch+ til I reach +rd Base+
And when I get home Imma hit home plate
Wait could this be considered our first date
"Ye the picture just looks so trash"
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian be a lady aaaaat it
You know whats a crazy thing
Some girlsll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin
Thats disrespectful baby dont encourage him

Dashiki kimono or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck I hit her with the text say
"Baby you up" uestion mark
And she respond "YESSSIR"

Everybody saying please dont let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box reach for it through the threshold
Uh through all of the stress though
Whats best of all people screaming like a festival
Just applaud this moment is special yall

We lost a four leaf clover
Dont ask why shorty be over
News flash shorty we over

You aint figured out what Im about yet
Always rockin that this aint out yet

When I go out niggers always out to get me in the studio
And I aint in the mood to flow

And they tryna act stupid oh
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy

This girl got a silicone booty
And got the nerve to act moody

Act like  throw her in a pool G

I know youre thinking thinking that it must be
Armor All flow cause it never get rusty
I aint gotta say it man dawg trust me
Bust somebody head GLC where was we
Still rock the Prada fore that rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore em all up
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up

Your fly is open McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
Im back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep Im still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him "do you have any grey poupon"

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Cant wait till they say "Ye ran up at the Oscars"
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters

And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
 glasses in a row you start to think I was QTip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin fallin down I aint drunk thats my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level aint at my waist level
Im fly get on a plane jet lagged already
Im tired the Goyard bags is heavy
Im fire the flow hard as a Chevy
I told her me like ye she said she like me ha
When see me with a CL like Pete Rock
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow they sit me right next to Big
And all these old rappers dont know where the exit is
But but but no buts nigga

We fired motherfuckers Donald Trump nigga
Im killin these niggas cant front nigga
Now lets drink to that until drunk nigga

He pulled up at  in a 
As he waving "Shorty hi" you know he showin his bling out
She got in the car he drove he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings she mad she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Yall be going through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep What do you think bout
If yall get a divorce
She gon take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club in the club tryna mingle
Meanwhile she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

Ay pimp its Ye pimp

So Imma ride down with the dos open

Yeah high inch stilettos with the toes open
And any haters get they nose broken

She told me they was cold now you act like you dont know
Like "ummmm ummmm" Imma hit the liquor store
Imma be on the low Imma have my hoodie on
If you call out my name then you know they gon go
Dumb you fuckin up my mode man

They already recognize me from my gold chain
The same one I gave Keyshia Cole man
Now go dumb like Cole on Martin Im retarded

Kanye to the
I ask God to help me fly away
And if not
Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me
You inspired me
To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember I love gold
Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind

Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin "Damn Ye snapped with this beat"
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in  again

Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks I done got  Cnotes
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
Fuckin with my girl today around threeoh
My man said lets call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough

Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong
Im just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I aint the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Lets talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
And Imma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do

Ma$e said cmon Mike said chamone
Started up early like RavenSymoné
Keisha KnightPull Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But yall cant hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word cant
round same time when Nas said I can
Bush for sendin our fam to Iran
Im in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me Im just a man
Right now Im trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just and em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga

Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "Man dont say that"
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back

I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured

Yeah Kanye to the yeah
Im with this bad Ethiopian chick drinkin straight up liquor
I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs
Have girls feet lookin like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with a name some rhyme nameless
Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause Im Im tryin to make it to Uranus
See thats a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life

Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently

Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like "chching"
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now"

It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn
Them the biggest tits I ever seen
We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded
Make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many B.I.s so much inspiration

Hey miss
Whos there
No time to do hair
Im through here
The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now
A rub down
Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie

Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese

Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch
 me Quence and Plain Pat bitch

From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghost’s style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer

Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around  Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around 
My man said "Lets call some girls that we know"
Sometimes I wanna say "Fuck my bitch"
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough

And my jacket kinda fresh bright red
And as usual my pants tightthreaded

More than a drink but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does

Her telling her homegirls that he couldnt stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said "I would if hell handle biz up in the sheets"
Pop off like a thang thang
He keep keep
And every time that she bang bang
He skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you Cassie and Kim Kardashian

I dont sweat it wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
People sayin "Ye we need another Yeezus" Ross grunt
Lames try to tell me "Cut the wildin out out"
But who the fuck is you reachin
Pass me  bottles champagne procession
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
Really Me Too aggressive

You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God

We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’mma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said “hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes bitch”
"Damn I’m only asking you a question"
I met this milf at the AllStar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar huh start it up
Start it up huh start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited the second I colonic’d it
Aint nobody fucking with me I Platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on bet niggas gon honor it
These aint even real clothes homie I’m pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I aint paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up said “It’s free” I said WOWZERS

I’m going in and I’ma go hard
I mean whats the point if it aint no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things you’re not aware of
No one’s prepared for the scale of this and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State you’re looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh Im breaking out the damn cage aghh
Hannibal Lector my American Psycho
A iller version of Ike yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris Im livin off your vitals
I mean I’ll be your con man I’ll be your damn liar
Lets start the interview I’ll be your vampire
I gotta feel you bite your neck to get familiar
And if you die guess what I fuckin killed you

You know what yo You a bitch
You should have a travel agent cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers they come in deuces
But when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking bout

Unfortunately for the rest of ya’ll
I’m way better than the best of all
And even though they focus on just the flaws
They still gonna annihilate the festivals
And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah yeah yeah I’ve been known to cover up my eyes
With the Ray Beons

Flashing lights the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like there’s no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why cause it’s going down

For all my young ladies ladies that driving Miss Daisy
Driving me crazy rock the beat baby
Hop up out the ERR she eat up the pavement
I dont give a ERR baby he crazy
Im back by unpopular demand
Least he still popping in Japan shopping in Milan
Hopping out the van screams from the fans
"Yeezy always knew youd be on top again"
And we bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King Junior
And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know its superficial and you say its just clothes
But we shopping in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin "How you do that"
So they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight I loved every minute

Martin Louie the King Jr
Starting all that stunting is gonna ruin you
If B.I. was alive hed probly have the tone
With the Grey Poupon anything Ye poop on
Will explode cause I am the shit and this is my commode
Uhoh there they go
Talkin bout how your boys clothes extratight
I just remembered that my limelight extrabright
I hit the strip club and girls get extrahype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extradyke
We know who not getting no sex tonight

Hermes pastel I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed that mean its permanent
So I guess we should address it huh
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track I asthma attack it
"Why you so mad for Why you gotta have it"
‘Cause I slaved my whole life now Im the master
Naaaaananaaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaananaaaaa
Tryin to get that Kobe number one over Jordan

Lollipop lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship til she hit the top
That hit the spot til she ask
"How many liiliilicks do it take til she get to shop"
Dont worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her "Girl like Doritos thats nacho cheese"
Tell her friends "Like Fritos Im trying to lay"
I cant only have one and I aint tryin to wait"
This a song with Wayne so you know its gonna melt
But you aint finna murder me like everybody else

When the pastor asked me why Im flashy

Niggas pullin out cash in wads

But I need you to get along while I get richer
Speakin of richer you talkin bout prior
Lets talk about now and the future which I am

But only an asshole can give you this much shit

Right about this time raise your glasses
Whats my motivation that ass is
Start a conversation like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I aint gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin again thats music to my ears
Whats you think my fuel was for all Of these years
Im inspired when people dont like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash thats cake and icing
I asked her you buying
She said no just sight seeing
Maybe thats just because you aint found the right thing yeah

Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin at the mirror wondering if its the same dude
Lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
Look right next to me wondering if its all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow I say "I know"
Then errrr away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey you might like this"
And see

I took his CD and asked him what hes lookin for
He said "Man I dont know. Maybe a miracle"

Excuse me but this verse

My New York nigga said he heard it at sons house
Talkin bout how this ho is poor as my low is

Swizz said she aint got no money in the bank
And she be standin there cause its cameras
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
If I fall in love a girl gon live on rodeo
Until that dayo she take the monorail
And I dont want no girl that will answer to "ayo"

Fuck a drank Imma buy tha bar if ya worth it

Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout

The arms race made em raise they arm and race straight to the top

Since they aint black when they get money they dont ball out boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out boy

He dress white so we gone dress whiter
So in spite of
Anything you mightve

He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
 of the best man like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
While niggas straight disrespectin him
So I did what they aint expect from him
Dropped The Dropout and blazed em
And aint nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
Im Kanye not Kayne
But to you Im Rick James bitch

Uh And Ill be trying to come around my girl acting like Mr

And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies

Clone

And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
