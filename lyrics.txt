i cant keep chasing em  
im taking my life back  
caught in a change  
twenty five to life  
  
i dont think she understands the sacrifices that ive made  
maybe if this bitch had acted right i wouldve stayed  
but ive already wasted over half of my life i wouldve laid  
down and died for you i no longer cried for you  
no more pain bitch you  
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
into the dirt i can no longer stand it  
now my respect i demand it  
im a take control of this relationship  
command it and im a be the boss of you now goddammit  
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me  
so you better hear me out this much you owe me  
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while ive stayed  
faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid  
look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess  
always in a rush to get back to you i aint heard you yet  
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect  
ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
and i know that if i end this ill no longer have nothing left  
but you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
and i wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath  
you know what youve done no need to go in depth  
i told you youd be sorry if i fucking left  
id laugh while you wept  
hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me  
did me a favor although my spirit free youve said  
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept  
its unfortunate but its  
  
  
too late for the other side  
caught in a chase  
twenty five to life  
too late for the other side  
caught in a chase  
twenty five to life  
  
i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
til i snap  
dont think im loyal  
all i do is rap  
i can not moonlight on the side  
i have no life outside of that  
dont i give you enough of my time  
you dont think so do you  
jealous when i spend time with the girls  
why im married to you still man i dont know  
but tonight im serving you with papers  
im divorcing you  
go marry someone else and make em famous  
and take away there freedom like you did to me  
treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you  
feed em the same shit you made me eat  
im moving on forget you oh  
now im special oh i didnt feel special when i was with you  
all i ever felt was this  
helplessness  
imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
chew me up and spit me out  
i fell for this so many times  
its ridiculous  
and still i stick with this  
im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
your as addictive as they get  
evil as they come vindictive as they make em  
my friends keep asking why i cant just walk away  
im addicted  
to the pain the stress the drama  
im drown in so i guess im a mess  
cursed and blessed  
but this time im a  
aint changing my mind  
im climbing out this abyss  
you screaming as i walk out that ill be missed  
but when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
you left me off your list

im the illest rapper to hold a cordless  
patrolling corners  
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters  
im meaner in action  
than rosco beating james tarteenyer   
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments  
i grew up in the wild hood  
as a hazardous youth  
with a fucked up childhood  
that i used as an excuse  
and aint shit changed  
but kept the same mindstate  
since the third time that i failed th grade  
you probably think that im a negative person dont be so sure of it  
i dont promote violence i just encourage it  
i laugh at the sight of death  
as i fall down a cement flight of steps  
and land inside a bed of spider webs  
so throw caution to the wind  
you and a friend  
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again  
shit why not blow your brain out  
im blowing mine out  
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now  
  
its only fair to warn  
i was born with a set of horns  
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord  
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board  
that smashed into your honda accord  
with a  door ford  
but im more toward droppin an accapella  
and choppin a fella  
to mozarella  
worse than a hellacopta propella  
got you locked in the cella  
with your skeleton showing  
developing anorexia  
while im standin next to ya  
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death  
with an iv in your veins  
feeding you liquid darvicet  
pumping you full of drugs  
pull the plugs  
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
who were picked up in an ambulance  
and driven  
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
and given  
a less than  percent chance  
of living  
have a possible placement  
its a hospital patient  
storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement  
doctor kevorkian has arrived  
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream im still alive  
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth  
better call the fire department  
ive hired a arson  
to set fire to carpet  
and burn up your entire apartment  
im a liar to start shit   
got your bitch wrapped around my dick  
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit  
  
met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg  
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg  
go to bed with the keg wake up with the   
mixed up with alka seltzer and formula d  
fuck an acid tab ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead  
no more said case closed end of discussion  
im blowin up like spontaneous human combustion  
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas  
cross the bombas   
we blowin up your house killing your parents  
and coming back to get your foster mommas  
and im as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus  
cause i aint making no more threats  
im doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets  
im more or less sick in the head  
maybe more cause i smoked crack   
today yesterday and the day before sabbath  
walk the block with a labrador  
strapit more corral for war than el salvador  
foul style galore  
verbal cow manure  
coming together like the eyebrow on al b  sure

so this is it  
this is what i wished for  
just isnt how i envisioned it  
fame to the point of imprisonment  
i just thought the shitd be different  
but something changed  
the minute that i got a whiff of it  
i started to inhale it  
smell it  
started sniffin it  
and it became my cocaine  
i just couldnt quit  
i just wanted a little bit  
then it turned me to a monster  
i became a hypocrite  
concert after concert  
  
i was raking in the dough  
rolling in green  
had the game hemmed up  
like a sewing machine  
but i was losing my freedom  
there was no where for me  
to not go and be seen  
and just go and be me  
and there was no inbetween  
you either loved it or hate it  
  
every cd critics gave it a three then three  
years later theyd go back and rerate it  
and call the slim shady lp the greatest  
the  mathers was a classic  
the  show was fantastic  
but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it  
i guess enough time just aint passed yet  
a couple more years that shitll be illmatic  
and eight years later im still at it  
divorce remarried  
a felon  
a father  
sleeping pill addict  
and this is real talk  
i feel like the incredible hulk  
my back has been broke and i can still walk  
  
so be careful what you wish for  
cause you just might get it  
and if you get it then you just might not know  
what to do wit it cause it might just  
come back on you tenfold  
  
i said  
  
be careful what you wish for  
cause you just might get it  
and if you get it then you just might not know  
what to do wit it cause it might just  
come back on you tenfold  
  
i got a letter from a fan that said  
hes been praying for me  
every day and for some reason  
its been weighing on my mind heavy  
cause i dont read every  
letter i get but something told me to go ahead and open it but  
why would someone pray for you when they dont know you  
you didnt pray for me when i was local  
and as i lay these vocals  
i think of all the shit i had to go through  
just to get to where im at  
ive already told you at least  
  
a thousand times in these rhymes  
i appreciate the prayer but ive already got  
god on my side  
and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it  
just watchin it from an opposite standpoint  
man boys got to look  
nuts  
and thats the only word i can think of right now  
on how  
to describe the shit  
this is like a vibe you get  
go ahead and bob to it  
just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit  
  
so be careful what you wish for  
cause you just might get it  
and if you get it then you just might not know  
what to do wit it cause it might just  
come back on you tenfold  
  
i said  
  
be careful what you wish for  
cause you just might get it  
and if you get it then you just might not know  
what to do wit it cause it might just  
come back on you tenfold

but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun  
cause id a killed them shit i woulda shot kim and him both  
this my life id like to welcome yall to the  show

but put yourself in my position just try to envision  
witnessin yo mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen  
bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin  
goin through public housing systems victim of munchhausens syndrome  
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt  
til i grew up now i blew up  
it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it  
wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma  
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma  
well guess what your gettin older now and  
its cold when your lonely and nathans growin up so quick  
hes gonna know that your phony  
and hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful  
but youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong  
bitch do your song  
keep tellin yourself that you was a mom  
but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get  
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit  
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  
well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be

wife beaters and white tshirts  
hanes mainly its a long shot but is it possible  
theres a lane maybe

he wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
he can see his name up in lights  
women screaming his fcking name feinting  
shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium  
joe shmoe made it he took his plain jane lady  
and his baby hailey out the trailer  
but he aint trailing anymore hes ahead of the race  
while maintaining his innocence  
little does he know his train is derailing  
and hes about to be raped by this game anally   
  
  
got to have it  
yeah i made it

willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
fake friends will kill for ya die for ya

nothings private anymore  
when your best friends say bye bye to him  
what kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
but this is what you wanted  aint it  
fck no the way that it turned out  
was nothing like the picture that i painted in my head  
sometimes a dream i make is more fun than to actually make it  
the game stripped me naked  
it robbed me of ever having another real relationship  
with another girl this world is a fcking trip  
as i slip in another world  
proceed take another hit  
sniff til i fcking url  
tell em all to fcking sit and spin til they fcking twirl

get familiar wit it  
  
  obie trice  
obie the person that came up and deverted  
cause of nervousness  
that was solely the homies verdict  
it was worth it  
cause he changed became so i observed it  
certain such of a purpose  
its like a different version  
so much hurtin and pain  
gave him game for certain  
thats why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
im so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher  
had enough of  
isolating myself in a room  
writing poems for songs doin the same in school  
now look what he became a fool  
cause he learned how to sustain his two  
and obtain fame from you  
living hard but still julliard  
a god walks and aint spent a day in a pew  
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
so welcome to the art department  
  
    
i stimulate the brain mimick  
emulate the sane  
sick of people thinkin its a fuckin mimick when it aint  
clinically insane  
brain is on venus  
suck your anus uranus  
label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
he may seem as though hes plain normal  
if you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they
say  
see the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say so hes vague  
so they mistake him for just bein crazed  
you dont think hes strange  
you turn around and tell him please and thanks  
and catch him flippin you off with his pants down  
hands around  
his scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs  
  
talking   
this is shade   
you know how motherfuckin serious this shit is  
this shit is so motherfuckin serious


i dont wanna say goodbye  
but sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
all i wanna do is cry  
say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
farewell miss i know that you can care less  
but im sorry for everything i was careless  
but i need you to know that i love you so much  
and ive been drinking myself to sleep my souls crushed  
a couple more shots i know im gonna go nuts  
i cant deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
i was in love with you how could you do this to me  
actually i did this to myself what a tragedy  
and now what do i do  
where do i go  
cause everywhere i go i see your face  
its hard starting over  
trying to find another shoulder  
to lean on  
i feel like my whole life just got peed on  
they say time heals but dammit i wanna stop time and feel this pain  
as crazy as it sounds to me its sane  
and i like it why cause i feel like were still united  
in some weird way i dont wanna fight it  
  
i dont wanna say goodbye  
but sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
all i wanna do is cry  
say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
i wrote you the other day and you didnt write back  
its like that after all the crap we been through  
i cant believe you i know i fucked up  
but look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up  
you keep sending me to voicemail  
im annoyed hell shit you coulda at least sent a text  
but youre probably busy kissing someone elses lips  
while im sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit  
youre hard headed a sharp headache  
i need help call a medic  
i just cut myself yeah i did it  
without you im nothing dont you get it  
every time that i said i loved you i meant it  
you turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
we ever met i cant believe you just said that  
youre so cold you just hit me so low  
i cant take this no more so hit the road  
  
i dont wanna say goodbye  
but sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
all i wanna do is cry  
say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
some things just dont seem the way they do  
 day you tell me i love you and only you  
i wake up to find out it was a dream  
youre telling me you hate me youre leaving me  
people change everything changes  
we go from best friends then become strangers  
we go from seeing each other everyday then  
farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
i cant get you outta of my head  
so im out of bed at  in the morning  
wishing i was dead  
but for some odd reason i cant do it  
for some reason i needed to write  
whats on my mind and whats going through it  
cause if i dont ill probably suffocate  
why do you have so much hate  
towards me you need some loving babe  
god i fucking love you i hate myself  
for falling in love with you  
just to find out all i did was trouble you  
my heart is aching im medicated  
i tried meditating  
but nothing works i dont even feel sedated  
i wish you could feel what i feel for one second  
i reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back  
opinions wouldnt matter what they thought in fact  
you would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
and do everything to have me if you could  
  
i dont wanna say goodbye  
but sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
all i wanna do is cry  
say my farewells pack up and leave tonight

life  
by marshal mathers  
what is life  
life is like a big obstacle  
in front of your optical to slow you down  
  
and every time you think you gotten past it  
its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
what are friends  
friends are people that you think are your friends  
but they really your enemies with secret identities  
and disguises to hide they true colors  
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
they want to come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin  
  
what is money  
money is what makes a man act funny  
money is the root of all evil  
moneyll make them same friends come back around  
swearing that they was always down  
  
what is life  
im tired of life  
im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
im tired of committing so many sins  
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins  
tired of never having any ends  
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
im tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins  
tired of not having a deal  
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
tired of drowning in my sorrow  
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo  
im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off  
im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour  
then this boss wonders why im smartin off  
tired of being fired every time i fart and cough  
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
im tired of using plastic silverware  
tired of working in building square  
tired of not being a millionaire

this is the season for noise pollution contamination  
examination of more cartoons than animation

sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs  
inside the depths of his basement  
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went  
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
none of my guys knew where im at i was doomed  
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume  
  
  
i make you think youre a best friend then  
why i oughtta  
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a best friend then  
why i oughtta  
stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
dealing with backstabbers there was one thing i learned  
theyre only powerful when you got your back turned  
i yearned for the day that we finally met again  
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine  
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean  
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
beating him over the head with the telephone

dj scratching  everybody walk out the back door  
  
dj scratching to fade


yo check it out its fucked up and i dont see either one of us budging  
  
im withholding my anger  
though id like to be the strangler  
of this punk ass little pussys puny neck  
its my right to insist  
that he acknowledge my existence  
but he just displays complete lack of respect  
thats what he says to himself  
as he uses magazines to trash me  
as he sits with both feet up at his desk  
smokes a bag of his weed  
and starts imagining things  
and he just cant see that hes manically depressed  
and in his jealousy and envy  
it just whirls him in a frenzy  
as he turns on mtv and sees my face  
he dont exist in this world  
so he just twists and he twirls  
spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
and its destroying him slowly  
cause he does not even know me  
even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
so he just tortures himself  
he has no fortune and wealth  
so he extorts someone else to get his dough  
and now hes acting like a bully  
so he tries to push and pull me  
but he knows that he cant pull me so hes mad  
he has no choice but to scream  
and raise his voice up at me  
cause it annoys him to see that i aint scared  
  
you aint no motherfucking bully  
and i aint bowing to no motherfucking bully  
i wont allow it aint no coward to no bully  
ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully  
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully  
  
and i know it must be fucking with you emotionally  
  
now im not trying to make no more enemies  
no more unfortunately  
theres so many motherfuckers that just are  
they just keep pounding at me  
now that im down with   
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja laughter  
but his ass is such a puppet  
irv could shove his whole hand up it  
and just make him say what he wants him to say  
but suge has irvs on a string  
and irvs so nervous that he  
says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
so now ja thinks that hes so tough  
and murder inc s the big bad wolf  
and they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
but our buildings made out of bricks  
so you aint taking out shit  
i know you just did a song with bobby brown  
so now you try to pull a race card  
and it backfires in your face hard  
cause you know we dont play that black and white shit  
plus this guy that you fucked  
when you was ecstasied up  
was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch  
  
you must be taking to much e  
  
now what bothers me the most  
about hiphop is we so close  
to picking up where we left off with big and pac  
we just lost jam master j  
big l got blasted away  
plus we lost bugs slayed son and freaky ta  
its like a neverending cycle  
that just seems to come full circle  
everyones gotta be so fucking hard  
im not excluding myself  
cause i been stupid as well  
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
but as we grow as men  
we learn to let shit go but then again  
theres only so much bullshit we can really stand  
we all got reps to uphold  
when someone steps on our toes  
its no exception it goes for every man  
but if irv really gave a fuck  
about ja like he claims he does  
hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
but he just keeps feeding him pills  
so if that e doesnt kill him  
someone from gunit will and i aint buzzed  
dawg im talking to you straight  
if the situation escalates  
any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game  
and if i get killed for this rap  
i got a million in cash  
that says i will get you back in halies name  
  
irvine get your boy off that e  
  
get at me dawg  
holla


scratched sample  im the man  
  
i stand in by the way as i begin  
do you know who i am and may reply with a grin  
yes im tired of being  
why should i be secluded i got a brand new horn to be tooted  
to sum it up in a nutshell  will you kick it for me  
so i find myself in a certaindepligatory  
a place where i dwell in for some wonderful productions  
to make up for lost time  
finally let loose unloading the stockpile  
a mental projectile i aim like a reptile  
i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus  
is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating  
how many times will it take you before you realize youre fading  
fading from existence cause simulations are dead  
theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read  
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor  
while i hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor  
words can weigh a ton  
therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
scratched samples  yeah its another  
  
there are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
but i see no borderline from under this colorblind  
and some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
but then im finally about to put an end to the hatred  
the world would never endure to arguing  
awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do  
you cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to  
the outcome we want nothing despicable  
so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and  
youre dull its time you faced this here taste this  
straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles  
the date of my birth on the earth the deliverence of a starchild  
rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
but with such a power there comes a responsibilty  
to infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear  
to form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend  
  
scratched samples  yeah its another  
  
you know i dont understand why we all just cant get along  
you hate me but you know me and what i stand for  
no so then why do you speak for me  
and every other white man when you that were your enemy  
  
on the floor lies a broken door cause im not to be spoken for  
stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
but ive apologies are exhausted  
feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
so who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted  
switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted  
pull up the quick  
these we hate him these are past us huh  
always fighting for the position of top dog  
that spots already occupied and i dont play leapfrog  
cause i do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine  
but im always having to proove myself time after time  
oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast  
judged from the past and hes put last  
and bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin  
and mutterin words with no meaning attack me side im like danny kane  
here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please  
ive got a craving  
  
scratched sample until end  im the man


tell myself that i was doin all right  
theres nothin left to do tonight  
but go crazy on you  
crazy on you  
  
let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
cant you see what you do to me baby  
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac  
im like a lunatic you make me sick  
youre truly the only one who can do this to me  
you just make me get so crazy  
i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic  
 minute i want to slit your throat the next i want to sex  
you make me crazy  
the way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
we fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe thats a bad habit  
cause the next day we right back at it  
in the same exact pattern  
what the fuck is the matter with us  
we cant figure out if its lust  
or its love which that is attractin us to each other  
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch  
but i stay and still stick it out with you  
even though i just hit you today but you deserved it  
you hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
just cause i came home late last night  
crawled in bed and i woke you  
but if theres one thing about you that i admire  
its baby because you stay with me  
maybe cause youre as crazy as i am  
cause when i look at you  
i can see an angel in your eyes but if i look deeper inside  
i see a freakish little side like a devil in disguise  
youre always full of surprises  
always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildos  
you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
youre only twenty four but youre plenty more mature  
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
like theyre in middle school still youre crazy sexy cool  
chill you play your position you never step out of line  
even though i stay in your business  
youve always kept out of mine  
i wonder whats on your mind  
sometimes they say love is blind  
maybe thats why the first time i dotted your eye  
you didnt see the sign  
or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
let me go crazy on you  
crazy on you  
let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
you are the ink to my paper  
what my pen is to my my pad  
the moral the very fiber  
the whole substance to my rap  
you are my reason for being  
the meaning of my existence  
if it wasnt for you i would never be able to spit this  
as intense as i do and the irony  
is you rely on me as much  
as i rely on you to inspire me like you do  
you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
youre my entire supply of gas the match and igniter  
the only way that im able to stay so stable  
is youre the legs to my table  
if you were to break id fall on my face  
but im always gonna make you feel  
i dont need you as much as i really need you  
so you dont use it to your advantage  
but youre essential to me  
youre the air i breathe  
i believe if you ever leave me  
id probably have no reason to be  
you are the kim to my   
youre the slim to my shady  
the dre to my   
the alana to my hailie  
you are the word that im lookin for  
when im tryin to describe how i feel inside  
and the right one just wont come to my mind  
youre like the pillar that props me up  
the beam that supports me  
the bitch who never took half  
the wife who never divorced me  
youre like the root to my evil  
you let my devil come out me  
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
and no matter how much too much is never enough  
maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
let me go crazy on you  
crazy on you  
let me go crazy crazy on you oh

while the world is fast asleep  
you can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
ever since tony montana told me that the world is mine  
i started to think positive  
left the negative behind  
and while the other stars were fast asleep  
i had to rise and shine  
its funny how ive got a brand new g shock on my wrist  
but i aint got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
and who committed the most crime  
 day i had a dream like martin  
back when i had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
they used to make jokes about me  
now look whos laughing

you have everything you need  
all it takes is all you got

and i can blow a hundred fast  
like usain bolt like when he ran for jamaica  
me giving up is against the law  
i work hard  
i play more  
i fell in love with my sold out tour  
sometimes i think some other artists love the after parties more  
fell victim to the don beat  
so when im all counting paper  
them man are just counting shit  
  
yeah  
yeah  
i was the boy in the corner  
made a transition into a champion  
my discovery was televised  
im talking anthem after anthem  
against all odds  
i made it look a walk in the park  
now its a brand new day  
and ill be doin it again  
its time for the main attraction  
  
you can own this city  
you have everything you need  
all it takes is all you got  
life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
you can own this city  
deep inside you hold the key  
while the world is fast asleep  
you can take it all if you just dare to dream

cause man its been rough but still i manage enough  
  
ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed  
my hands have been cuffed  
but i dont panic and huff frantic and puff  
or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts

and im sick of struggling and suffering see  
my destinys to rest at ease till im impressed and pleased  
with my progress i wont settle for less than cheese  
  
im on a quest to seize all my own label to call  
way before my baby is able to crawl  
im too stable to fall the pressure motivates  
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades  
  
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth  
where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf kyu  
  
  
  
im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps  
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep  
praying for sleep  
dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
in this slaughtering house caught up in bouts  
with the root of all evil  
ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
and make them do shit illegal  
for these grants and jacksons  
these transactions explain a mans actions  
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity  
  
through god and theres a wish he granted me  
he showed me how to cope with the stress  
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed  
always groping a mess of flying over the nest  
  
to selling dope with the rest  
i quit smoking cess to open my chest  
life is stressful inside this cesspool  
trying to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel  
  
my little brothers trying to learn his mathematics  
hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts  
kids attract static children with automatics  
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets  
  
im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
i wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
its cumbersome im trying to do well on this earth  
but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth

or one opportunity  
to seize everything you ever wanted  
in one moment  
would you capture it  
or just let it slip  
  
yo  
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy  
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti  
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin  
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud  
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out  
hes chokin how everybodys jokin now  
the clocks run out times up over blaow  
snap back to reality oh there goes gravity  
oh there goes rabbit he choked  
hes so mad but he wont give up that easy no  
he wont have it he knows his whole back citys ropes  
it dont matter hes dope he knows that but hes broke  
hes so stacked that he knows when he goes back to his mobile home thats
when its  
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody  
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him  
  
  
you better lose yourself in the music the moment  
you own it you better never let it go  
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow  
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
the souls escaping through this hole that its gaping  
this world is mine for the taking  
make me king as we move toward a new world order  
a normal life is borin but super stardoms close to post mortar  
it only grows harder only grows hotter  
he blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter  
lonely roads god only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father  
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water  
his hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product  
they moved on to the next schmo who flows he nose dove and sold nada  
so the soap opera is told and unfolds i suppose its old partna but the beat
goes on  
da da dumb da dumb da da

tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged

i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
but i kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cipher  
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper  
all the pain inside amplified by the  
fact that i cant get by with my nine to  
 and i cant provide the right type of  
life for my family cause man these god damn food stamps dont buy diapers  
and its no movie theres no mekhi phifer  
this is my life and these times are so hard  
and its getting even harder tryin to feed and water my seed plus  
see dishonor caught up between bein a father and a primadonna  
baby mama drama screamin on and too much  
for me to want to say in one spot another jam or not

to formulate a plot fore i end up in jail or shot  
success is my only motherfuckin option failures not  
mom i love you but this trail has got to go i cannot grow old in salems

so here i go is my shot   
feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that i got  
  
  
  
you can do anything you set your mind to man


a distant alarm a sound from far away  
we raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
the restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
anxiety is rising the sky is turning dark  
a riot is emerging men beat men to death  
this is unexplainable a fight without a battle  
the alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker  
this is not a drill i repeat this is not a drill  
  
today we die today we testify  
all we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
reversed evolving turning people into beasts  
theyre feasting on eachother strong consume the weak  
flaming ruins society is lost  
shattered city streets filled with blind nameless creatures  
the sky cracks open dust is descending  
breath the black air feel darkness in your lungs  
silence  nothing makes a sound  
but we can still hear the sound of the alarm  
  
today we die today we testify  
all we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
a distant early warning  
a sound from far away  
we raised our heads  
towards the sky  
towards the alarm

now youre getting fucking sick of looking at em  
you swore youve never hit em never do nothing to hurt em  
now youre in each others face  
spewing venom and these words when you spit em  
you push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em  
throw em down pin em so lost in the moments when youre in em  
its the rage thats the culprit it controls you both  
so they say its best to go your separate ways  
guess that they dont know ya cause today that was yesterday  
yesterday is over its a different day  
sound like broken records playin over but you promised her  
next time youll show restraint  
you dont get another chance  
life is no nintendo game but you lied again  
now you get to watch her leave

but thats alright because i like the way it hurts  
just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
but thats alright because i love the way you lie  
i love the way you lie  
i love the way you lie  
  
now i know we said things did things  
that we didnt mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
same routine but your tempers just as bad as mine is  
youre the same as me but when it comes to love youre just as blinded  
baby please come back it wasnt you  
baby it was me maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems  
maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano  
all i know is i love you too much to walk away now  
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
dont you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk  
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball  
next time im pissed ill aim my fist at the dry wall  
next time there will be no next time  
i apologize even though i know its lies  
im tired of the games i just want her back i know im a liar  
if she ever tries to fucking leave again  
im a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
but thats alright because i like the way it hurts  
just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
but thats alright because i love the way you lie  
i love the way you lie

sometimes i wonder whats your purpose in life that is  
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit  
you living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
you say its gonna stop but it   just   slows   down  
  
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this  
mystery whatever your reason even is to be  
you say you want to be with me but how can you say that  
when you got niggas hiding in your closet  
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
i met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me

and said oh its like that  
  
she said she just broke up with her nigga and shit

got to the crib and called her up  
we got into a good conversation thats when she asked me could i fuck  
i said maxine check this out

got to the crib she let me in  
she didnt waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
i said hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things   
what the fuck are you doing  
  
so i went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing  
as she went for my midsection  
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt  
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about putting in work  
  
before i hit it she said

i said what is it another nigga its ok  
she said no i forgot to tell you that i got aids

brain contemplatin clean out the register  
dip before somebody catches ya  
or gets ya description and sketches ya  
then connects you as the prime suspect  
but i aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
cause i got a daughter to feed  
and two hundred dollars aint enough to water the seed the best thing  
would be for me to leave taco bell and hit up chess king  
and have the lady at the desk bring  
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac  
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
this bitch tried escapin the jack  
grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote  
you barely heard a word as she choked  
it wasnt nothin for her to be smoked  
then i slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke  
just then the pigs bust in yellin freeze  
but im already wanted for sellin kis  
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees  
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
i bust shots they bust back  
hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest  
  
  
  
left the house pullin out the drive backin out

shut ya yakkin mouth  
fore i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
drug her by her hair smacked her up  
thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up  
stole her car made a profit  
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
like the girl on set it off did  
jetted off kid stole the whip now im a criminal  
drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool  
climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
i made it out alive but im injured badly though  
parents screamin son go in and call the police  
tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace  
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo sixty four  
when they sell out in stores the price triples  
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles  
and collided with an eightyyear old lady with groceries  
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties  
stood up and started to see stars  
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars  
barely escaped musta been some dumb luck  
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck  
but i think somebody seen me maybe  
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i musta dropped the beanie baby  
fuck it i give up im surrounded in blue suits  
came out with a white flag hollerin truce truce  
dont shoot surrendered my weapon to cops  
wasnt me  
it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnapps

visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
with sugar plums oh look here comes  hes on your street  
hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
now walk on em hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
like a thanksgiving turkey or holiday ham  
cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam  
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jon benet ramsey  
i guess a modern day jack the ripper is all that i am

my pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged i know  
i put on my mothers make up get naked and run around  
wavin the gun around i think im down to a hundred pounds

the devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out  
i must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about  
voices are leading me up to the attic i love my house  
they pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box  
comes from inside a toy chest but what do i do its locked  
i pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts  
i dig till i find it i wind it up and the tune just starts  
its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark  
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess ill loom in the park  
  
  
  
im fixated on asphyxiating and breakin this little chicks  
neck like a pixie stick  
the sick satan worshippin bitches get horsewhippins  
im in the back through the back door slip in  
through the crack leavin the corpse drippin  
the mortician of love sent from above  
forced and treat em all  stingy ive become  
been doin this for more than a quarter century im just numb  
am i dreamin is it real someone pinch me on the buns  
the time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder  
id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her  
then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
with the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her  
but before i do that ill have a chat to flatter her  
give her two compliments backtoback like tabatha  
im your secret admirer im back to ravish ya  
so strong is your fight but your no match for dracula  
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbin her  
dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her  
zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera  
stand back cause here comes your man jack so pamela

and walk around the rest of my life spit on  
and kicked and hit with shit every time

more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade standin on ronnies grave  
screamin at the sky til clouds gather its clyde mathers and bonnie jade  
and thats pretty much the gist of it the parents are pissed but the kids

hatred and attitude tear us entirely  chloe mitchell

in my past you on the other side of the glass
of my memorys museum

the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the roc

they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself

flow infectious give me  seconds
ill have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
its funny how wasnt nobody interested
til the night i almost killed myself in lexus

now was kanye the most overlooked yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
thatll take freeway throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli i put him on songs with jayz
im the gap like banana republic and old navy and oooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bunb when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him  ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous now everybody love kanye
im almost raymond
some say he arrogant  can yall blame him
it was straight embarrassing how yall played him
last year shoppin my demo i was tryin to shine
every motherfucker told me that i couldnt rhyme
now i could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas so they say that im gassed
but without it id be last so i ought to laugh
so i dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
you niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
you cant say shit to kanye west no more
i rocked  people i was just on tour nigga
im kan the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse now she louis vuitton mom
i aint play the hand i was dealt i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
oh my god is that a black card
i turned around and replied why yes
but i prefer the term african american express
brains power and muscle like dame puffy and russell
your boy back on his hustle you know what ive been up to
killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
mayonnaisecolored benz i push miracle whips

i met this girl when i was  years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she said excuse me lil homie i know you dont know me
but my name is windy and i like to blow trees
and from that point i never blow her off
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to tow em off
and make em straighten up their hat
‘cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
i told her in my heart is where shell always be
she never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye keep making that keep making that
keep making that platinum and gold for me

but if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her but when i talk to her
it always seems like she talking bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got til its gone
i guess thats why im here and i cant come back home
and guess when i heard that when i was back home
every interview im representin you makin you proud
reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
if you dont know by now im talking bout chitown

and like my wife said i still didnt say no
people tryna say im goin crazy on twitter
my friends best advice was to stay low
i guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
especially when you got family members on payroll
the media said it was outlandish spendin
the media said hes way out of control
i just feel like im the only one not pretendin
im not out of control im just not in they control
i know im the most influential
that time cover was just confirmation
this generations closest thing to einstein
so dont worry about me im fine
i can see a thousand years from now in real life

troll conventional thought dont need to question
i know its antiquated so sometimes i get aggressive

havin moneys not everything not havin it is
i was splurgin on tryst but when i get my card back
activated im back to vegas
cause the good life i always had a passion for flashin
befo i had it i closed my eyes and imagined the good life

back when they thought pink polos would hurt the roc
before cam got the shit to pop

im trying to right my wrongs
but its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
vegas on acid seen through yves st  laurent glasses
and ive realized that ive arrived
cause it take more than a magazine to kill my vibe
does he write his own rhymes well sort of i think em
that mean i forgot better shit than you ever thought of
damn is he really that caught up
i ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
i remember i couldnt afford a ford escort
or even a fourtrack recorder
so its only right that i let the top drop on a droptop porsche
its for yourself thats important
if your stripper name porscha and you get tips from many men
then your fat friend her nickname is minivan
excuse me thats just the henny man
i smoke i drink im supposed to stop i cant because

i was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
alicia keys tried to talk some sense in him
 minutes later sein theres no convincin him
what more could you ask for the international asshole
who complain about what he is owed
and throw a tantrum like he is  years old
you gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
and wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
when he came in the game he made his own lane
now all i need is yall to pronounce my name
its kanye but some of my plaques they still say kayne
got family in the d kinfolk from motown
back in the chi them folks aint from moe town
life movin too fast i need to slow down
girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
my father been said i need jesus
so he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
the preacher said we need leaders
right then my body got still like a paraplegic
you know who you call you got a message then leave it
the roc stand tall and you would never believe it
take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
after debris settles and the dust get swept off
big k pick up where young hov left off
right when magazines wrote kanye west off
i dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ars lookin like pssh we messed up
grammy night damn right we got dressed up
bottle after bottle till we got messed up
in the studio with really doe yeah he next up
people askin me if im gon give my chain back
thatll be the same day i give the game back
you know the next question dog yo where dame at
this track the indian dance to bring our reign back
whats up with you and jay man are yall ok man
they pray for the death of our dynasty like amen
rrrrright here stands a man
with the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

i get down for my grandfather who took my mama
made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
at the tender age of  she was arrested for the sitins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different
now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
but we can make it to jacobs and to the dealership
swear i hear new music and i just dont be feelin it
racisms still alive they just be concealin it
but i know they dont want me in the damn club
they even made me show id to get inside of sams club
i done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
swear ive been baptized least  or  times
but in the land where niggas praise yukons and getting paid
its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
so i promised to mr  rainey im gonna marry your daughter
and you know i gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
and i know that you were smiling when you see the car i bought her
you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
but i cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
cause look what an accident did to left eye
first aaliyah now romeo must die
i know i got angels watching me from the other side

its the hard knock life tour sellout picture
us in the mall coppin iceberg and yell out jigga
yeah thats what well yell out yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell bout
jay and ye so shy
now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind he could change your life
with all these beats i did at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothing handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint 
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hed bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin s o b s and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steeple
and we know new jack city got to keep my brother
but to be number one imma beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it like pickandroll
cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
but my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate espanol no way jose
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse

and i’ll never let my son have an ego
he’ll be nice to everyone wherever we go
i mean i might even make him be republican
so everybody know he love white people
and i’ll never let him leave his college girlfriend
and get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
and i’ll never let him ever hit the telethon
i mean even if people dyin’ and the world ends
see i just want him to have an easy life
not like yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
don’t want him to be hated all the time judged
don’t be like your daddy that would never budge
and i’ll never let him ever hit a strip club
i learned the hard way that ain’t the place to get love
and i’ll never let his mom move to la
knowin’ she couldn’t take the pressure now we all pray

i think i just fell in love with a porn star
turn the camera on she a born star
turn the corners in a foreign car
call the coroners do the cpr
she gave that old nigga a ulcer
her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
make her knees shake make a priest faint
make a nun cum make her cremate
move downtown cop a sweet space
livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes what
we headed to hell for heaven’s sakes huh
well i’mma levitate make the devil wait yeah

never in your wildest dreams
never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
you could hear the loudest screams
comin’ from inside the screen you a wild bitch
tell me what i gotta do to be that guy
said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
or do anal or do a gangbang
it’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
well i guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
and if we run trains we all in the same gang
runaway slaves all on a chain gang
bang bang bang bang bang

 day i’m gon marry a porn star
we’ll have a bigass crib and a long yard
we’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
nothin’ to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
she wanna role play til i roll over
i’mma need a whole day at least rolled doja
what party is we goin’ to on oscar day
specially if she can’t get that dress from oscar de
la renta they wouldn’t rent her they couldn’t take the shame
snatched the dress off her back and told her “get away”

and anything that happen is for a reason
and niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
and gran keep praying and keep believing
in jesus and one day that you see him
til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
the devil is alive i feel him breathin
claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
and put them lottery tickets just to tease us

i hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
i hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
i hate when i leave and smell like the crib
whats the cause of the poor smell
she said i just cleaned up
baby i cant tell
why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like love spell
or that god damn cucumber bath and body works
i can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
what about cool water that shit probably worse
this here a classic like the lodi dodi verse
and my man probably hollered at the hottie first
i score he took the charge
oooh that shit gotta hurt

its the nigga they love to hate
but all the bad model bitches they love to date
you need to check my swag and get up to date
check check my swag and get up to date
we in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
she cant clean but i bet she got a vacuum mouth
and i bet im going to sweat her vidal sassoon out
her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
for the team

he walked in our lives i was only five
superman pajamas i was super duper fly
sittin there like why he at least hoopersize
you know i scrutinize like who this newer guy
im my mama boyfriend im her little husband
i was the man of the house when it wasnt
tryna get to know me homie just kill the charm
you aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
we all the voices of our parents bad choices
the aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
and babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
and the last thing i want to see is mamas new nigga
you old old spice wearing short chain wearing
dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
when you first stop caring about your appearance
when you get here anyway i already got parents
dont try to put me in line i already got crayons
my mama said i could do it i already got clearance
keep your hands off my mama how anita got clarence
yall i know she look good but you need to stop staring
i drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
but the door was locked and the tv up so loud
i screamed out i aint going to sleep no time soon
and when i do im sleeping in my mamas room

twenty years later where has the time gone
now you see im dating having problems of my own
now that im grown the tables turned around
i never thought id ever raise another niggas child
he dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unspike lee
but he be like d bo round his mama there
cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
he be wilding out be calm
i dont drink the drama or sip the domtylerperryon
you gonna marry my mom look i dont read palms
and i dont read psalms but i did take little man to church
took little man to school
look little man kids dont make the rules
even though i aint raised you you your mamas angel
dont get it twisted baby boy ill ving rhames you

there must be more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimized
thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
and mess with other girls part time to improvise
i knew she wasn’t bi
no i seen it in her eyes
but im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
she telling me about how black people should enterprise
and im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from enterprise
that i rented yesterday and gotta have in by 
with the gas fully filled up like i didnt drive
told her i had a girl nah fuck it i didnt lie
told her this rap game is alright  im just getting by
she had a lil weed and would get a lil high
and im looking in her eyes and im loving her vibe
told me back in  she fell in love with the tribe
boo back in  i was just like you
please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
like any other nigga that claim they hate school
and think yeah frees banging but shes no rachel

was it something i did wrong
yeah i know im wrong
shes at home alone and im always gone
hate it when she mad but more when she passive
now she on the internet looking for classes
out of state though man that hurt yo
but i got work though and im at work yo
and she dont call a lot
and when she do she pouring out her heart
you never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
and i promised her everything
told her when i get a deal ill get her a wedding ring
but when i got my deal i was back in the ring
fighting my urges strip club splurges
never had money so i felt like a virgin
and im trying to break the banks cherry
tryin to see can i afford canaries
with a ferrari and a dinner date with halle berry
went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
no im trying to call  one ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
her mother picked up the phone
like she in school and she dont stay here no more
i guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
so her chance of having a husband just minimize
i guess thats why she says she aint into guys
and focus on school fulltime to improvise

somebody told me that deltas brownskinned akas lightskinned
and they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
first day of school imma take you sight seein
show you what we do on weekends for excitement
she said i know what you about to say like your hypeman
last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
and if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but

roll some think i’ll roll some
to know some if we both honest
who lasts yeah you lie
spent the whole summer
tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
but i know whats mine when i see it
i know i know i know when i see it
riding down the  baby
pacing thinking to myself
if i should make it right
when i pulled up to the light
and then my phone started ringing
diamonds in the colors of those eyes
don’t know why but i know a sign when i see it

yeezy neyo the remix ayo
