Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Yeah  
Too late  
I cant keep chasing em  
Im taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that Ive made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed  
But Ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
Im a take control of this relationship  
Command it and Im a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while Ive stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
Ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this Ill no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath  
You know what youve done no need to go in depth  
I told you youd be sorry if I fucking left  
Id laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free youve said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its  
  
  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
  
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Dont think Im loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Dont I give you enough of my time  
You dont think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why Im married to you still man I dont know  
But tonight Im serving you with papers  
Im divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you  
Feed em the same shit you made me eat  
Im moving on forget you oh  
Now Im special Oh I didnt feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
Im addicted  
To the pain the stress the drama  
Im drown in so I guess Im a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time Im a  
Aint changing my mind  
Im climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that Ill be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
You left me off your list  
  
Fuck you hiphop  
Im leaving you my life sentence is served bitch  
And its just  
  
  
  
Too late  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life

Ohyea ohyea ohyea  
Oh oh  
Oh  
Ohyea ohyea ohyea ohyeaohyea  
Oh  
Woah  
There is no escaping yoyo  
Theres no place to hideyoyo  
You scream someone save meyoyo  
But they dont pave no mind yo yo  
Good night  
Good bye  
  
Your walkin down a horror corridor  
Its almost four in the mornin  
And your in a nightmare  
Its horrible  
Right theres the coroner  
Waitin for you  
To turn the corner  
So he can corner ya  
Your a goner  
Hes on a ya  
Out the corner of his cornea  
He just saw you run  
All you want is to rest  
Cause you cant run anymore  
Your done  
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience  
While everybody  
Is watchin in the party applauding it  
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again  
Contemplating my next plot again  
Swallowin a colata pin  
While Im noddin  
In and out on the ottoman and  
If the Ramada Inn  
Holdin onto the pill bottle then  
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom  
And make sure I got all of it  
Wake up naked at Mcdonalds  
With  
Blood all over me  
Dead bodies  
Behind the counter  
Shit  
Guess I must of just blacked out again  
Not again  
  
  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
I said  
Its three am in the mornin  
Put my key in the door  
Theres bodies layin all of the floor and  
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em  
Killed em  
  
Sitting nude in my living room  
Its almost noon  
I wonder whats on the tube  
Maybe theyll show some boobs  
Surfing every channel  
Until I find Hannah Montana  
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin  
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin  
Every candle on top of the fire place  
Mantalin  
Grab my flannel and my bandana then  
Kiss the naked manequin man again  
You can see him standin in my  
Front window  
If you look in  
Im just a hooligan  
Whos use to usin hallucinogens  
Causin illusions again  
Brain contusions again  
Cutting and bruising the skin  
Raise the scissors and pins  
Jesus when does it end  
Phases that I go through  
Dazed and not so confused  
Days that I dont know who  
Gave these molecules too  
Me  
What am I gone do  
Hey the prodigal son  
The diabolical one  
Very methodical  
When I slaughter dem  
  
  
  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
She puts the lotion in the bucket  
He puts the lotion on the skin  
Or else it gets the hose again  
  
I duck and I slash slice and gash  
Last night was a blast  
I cant quite remember when I  
Had that much fun  
Off a half pint fifth of Jack  
My last Vic and a half  
A flashlight  
Up Kim Kardashians ass  
  
I remember the first time  
I dismembered the family member  
December I think it was  
I was having drinks with my cousin  
And I wrapped him  
In Christmas lights  
Pushed him into the stinkin tub  
Cut him up into pieces  
Then just when I went to drink his  
Blood  
I thought I outta drink his bath water  
That outta be fun  
Thats when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun  
The sight of blood excites me  
That might be an artery son  
Your blood coverin screams  
Just dont seem to bother me none  
Its three am  
And here I come  
So you should probably run  
A secret passage way around here  
Man theres got to be one  
Oh no theres probably none  
He can scream all that he wants  
Top of his lungs  
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him upup  
  
  
  
yo yo  
A yo a yo  
yo yo  
A yo a yo

Im the illest rapper to hold a cordless  
Patrolling corners  
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters  
Im meaner in action  
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer   
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments  
I grew up in the wild hood  
As a hazardous youth  
With a fucked up childhood  
That I used as an excuse  
And aint shit changed  
But kept the same mindstate  
Since the third time that I failed th grade  
You probably think that Im a negative person dont be so sure of it  
I dont promote violence I just encourage it  
I laugh at the sight of death  
As I fall down a cement flight of steps  
And land inside a bed of spider webs  
So throw caution to the wind  
You and a friend  
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again  
shit why not Blow your brain out  
Im blowing mine out  
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now  
  
Its only fair to warn  
I was born with a set of horns  
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord  
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board  
That smashed into your Honda Accord  
With a  door Ford  
But Im more toward droppin an accapella  
And choppin a fella  
To mozarella  
Worse than a hellacopta propella  
Got you locked in the cella  
With your skeleton showing  
Developing anorexia  
While Im standin next to ya  
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death  
With an iv in your veins  
Feeding you liquid darvicet  
Pumping you full of drugs  
Pull the plugs  
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs  
Who were picked up in an ambulance  
And driven  
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants  
And given  
A less than  percent chance  
Of living  
Have a possible placement  
Its a hospital patient  
Storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement  
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived  
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "IM STILL ALIVE"  
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp  
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth  
Better call the fire department  
Ive hired a arson  
To set fire to carpet  
And burn up your entire apartment  
Im a liar to start shit   
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick  
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit  
  
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg  
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the   
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula D  
fuck an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
Im blowin up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas  
Cross the bombas   
We blowin up your house killing your parents  
And coming back to get your foster mommas  
And Im as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets  
Im more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more cause I smoked crack   
Today yesterday and the day before sabbath  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Buncha missle launchers n a buncha contra  
Banvan full of ganja now come on ja

Doin the chacha and the cucaracha with a quadra  
Polegic boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."  
Lindsey to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya  
Whod a knew the pewd a do to me what its done  
Such sinasism when it isnt in my system.  
Bluntigmatism betta spliff up to my lips son  
So much on my hands I gotta give my kids a fistbump.  
Christopher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks  
"Mista help me"s what he said to me and then sunk.  
Women skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks  
In clumps the woman with cocoabutter skin once.  
  
  
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
Skin em up hem em sew em up in those kilts  
Up in those kilts uppaup in those kilts.  
Man you dont want to go up in those hills  
Up in those hills uppaup in those hills.  
You better beware stay clear of Buffalo Bill  
Buffalo Bill BuffaBuffalo Bill.  
  
Always you can see him lurkin in the hallways  
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.  
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place  
Hide em in the wall well how long will the drywall take  
Well fuck it then Ive got nothin but time Ill wait.  
Until it dries for the moment I guess youre all safe.  
After I sand it and buff it I guess that Ill paint  
My chainsaws outta gas my regular saw aint.  
Now here I come again damn stomach rumblin  
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within.  
Someones in the back of my damn house rummagin  
Its a girl she looks pretty thin but I want her skin.  
Been on the hunt again when will it ever end  
Evelyn why you tryin to fight You will never win.  
Severin legs arms damn there goes another limb.  
Pull the lever then trap door death is evident.

Fuckin hoe ya better fuckin hold still.  
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket dont spill.  
Cut em gut em n just get to stuffin those girls.

And push it right through her while ya put your shishkebab skewers  
Into her barbaquer Would ya do to her  
What ya usually do to a girl whos skins newer"  
"In a world of sindoer this is turnin into a  
Torment tournament of sorts Christmas ornaments you are."  
Ill be sure to Ginsue ya til theres no more skin to ya.  
Booya who ya think your fuckin with  
Duck because here he comes again.

You bout to witness hip hop in its  
Most purest most rawest form flow almost flawless

Chip off the old block but old doc is  
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin  
Oh God Saddams got his own Laden  
With his own private plane his own pilot  
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges boom sound  
Oranges peach pears plums syringes  
Yeah here I come  
Im inches away from you here fear none  
Hip hop is in a state of  so

Must be a circus in town lets shut the shit down  
On these clowns can I get a witness  
Hell Yeah  
  
Quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles  
Gee willikers Dre holy bat syllables  
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham  
When Im gone time to get rid of these rap criminals  
So skip to ya Lou while I do what I do best  
You aint even impressed no more you used to it  
Flows too wet nobody close to it  
Nobody says it was til everyone knows the shit  
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated  
On eighties songs  
Exaggerate it all so much  
They make it all up  
Theres no such thing  
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans  
It just means so much more to so much more  
People when you rappin and you know what for  
The show must go on so Id like to welcome yall  
To  and Andres carnival  
Come on Now

 old friends why panic  
You already whos fully capable the two caped heroes  
Dial straight down the center eight hundred  
You can even call collect the most feared duet  
Since me and Elton play career Russian Roulette  
And never even seen me blink get me bustin a sweat  
People steppin over people just to rush to the set  
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely  
Ease ova these beats and be so breezy  
Jesus how can shit be so easy  
How can one Chandra be so Levy  
Turn on these beats MCs dont see me  
Believe me BET and MTV  
Are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo sheezy  
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me  
Til we grow beards get weird and disappear into the mountains

Until our dying day until were old and gray  
  
So until next time friends  
Same blond hair same rap channel  
Goodnight everyone thank you for coming  
Your host for the evening  
  
Oh Ha


So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isnt how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shitd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldnt quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no inbetween  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three then three  
Years later theyd go back and rerate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The  Mathers was a classic  
The  Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just aint passed yet  
A couple more years that shitll be illmatic  
And eight years later Im still at it  
Divorce remarried  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I got a letter from a fan that said  
Hes been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
Its been weighing on my mind heavy  
Cause I dont read every  
Letter I get but something told me to go ahead and open it but  
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you  
You didnt pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where Im at  
Ive already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got  
God on my side  
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it  
Just watchin it from an opposite standpoint  
Man boys got to look  
Nuts  
And thats the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold


You are now listening to the sounds ofShady
andAlchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist  
Got an axe in the duffel bag couple of fags  
Stuffed in the backseat muzzled n gagged  
Wrapped in bubble wrap two lesbians ahh  
Couple hustler mags now grab the pez dispenser  
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers  
The governor of Alaska She lusts when I ask her  
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh  
While we hover over Nebraska  
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture  
In the helicopter man I cant fuck her no faster  
Shes screaming grab my titties shady suck on those bastards  
But I aint no sucker I wont snuggle up with her after  
Im a gigolo But Yall look like the juggalo rapper  
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper  
Shit Back down  
Man Id rather lick on a scrotum  
And eat the fucking octa Moms pussy lips with some okra  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg Sizzle with Oprah  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa  
Getting home and play dick swords with the JonasBrothers  
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers Like no other  
I keep thinking of her smothered in somas  
Its chemical warfare Drop bombs like sadam  
Im bringing the drama Like Barrack Obama  
Playing rock em sock em robots with the Octo Mama  
Im vato loco homie Ill cock those llamas  


Wheres my snare  
I have no snare in my headphones  
There you go yeah yo yo  
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against  
I have Ive been protested and demonstrated against  
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times  
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind  
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin  
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep goin  
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin  
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evening  
Leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth  
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out  
Look at me now I bet ya probably sick of me now  
Aint you mama Im a make you look so ridiculous now  
  
  
I said Im sorry mama  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to make you cry  
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  
  
I got some skeletons in my closet and  
I dont know if no one knows it  
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it  
Im a expose it Ill take you back to   
Before I ever had a multiplatinum sellin CD  
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months  
My fagot father must have had his panties up in a bunch  
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye  
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die  
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her side  
Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and I  
Try to make it work with her at least for Hailies sake  
I maybe made some mistakes but Im only human  
But Im man enough to face them today  
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb  
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun  
Cause Id a killed them shit I woulda shot Kim and him both  
This my life Id like to welcome yall to The  Show  
  
  
  
Now I would never dis my own mama  
Just to get recognition  
Take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin  
But put yourself in my position just try to envision  
Witnessin yo mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen  
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin  
Goin through public housing systems victim of Munchhausens syndrome  
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt  
Til I grew up now I blew up  
It makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it  
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma  
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma  
Well guess what your gettin older now and  
Its cold when your lonely and Nathans growin up so quick  
Hes gonna know that your phony  
And Hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful  
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong  
Bitch do your song  
Keep tellin yourself that you was a mom  
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get  
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit  
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be  
  



  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
     
This was a beat with no words at first its a blank painting  
Exercising the mind its brain strength training  
Starts off something like shadys an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady thats a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name baby  
Wife beaters and white tshirts  
Hanes mainly its a long shot but is it possible  
Theres a lane maybe  
If not hes gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his fcking name feinting  
Shady did it he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore hes ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And hes about to be raped by this game anally.  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted  
  
     
Youre operating on all cylinders  
Syllables spit like dillingers  
Spilling your guts  
People are feeling your mic skills  
But these haters are ice grillin ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya die for ya  
But you cant decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasnt like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
But this is what you wanted  aint it  
Fck no the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship  
With another girl this World is a fcking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed take another hit  
Sniff til I fcking url  
Tell em all to fcking sit and spin til they fcking twirl  
Middle finger up again  
Relapsing back in this game oh well fck it then  
  
  
Got to have it  
Yeah I made it  
Im addicted


Ladies and gentlemen  
The moment youve all been waiting for  
In this corner weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds  
With a record of seventeen rapes four hundred assaults and four murders  
The undisputed most diabolic villain in the world  
Slim Shady  
  
  
So crack a bottle let your body waddle  
Dont act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto  
Ooh ooh bitches hopping in my Tahoe  
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes  
Now wheres the rubbers Whos got the rubbers  
I noticed theres so many of them  
And theres really not that many of us.  
Ladies love us my posses kicking up dust.  
Its on till the break of dawn  
And were starting this party from dusk  
  
OK lets go  
  
Back with Andre the giant mister elephant tusk  
Picture us youll just be another one bit the dust  
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus  
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts  
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks  
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.  
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.  
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.  
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought  
Cause when I spit the verse the shit  
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce  
If I could fit the words as picture perfect works every time  
Every verse every line as simple as nursery rhymes  
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.  
I venture to say were the center of attention its true  
Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal  
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trios back on you hoes.  
  
  
  
Ladies and gentlemen   
  
  
They see that low rider go by theyre like Oh my  
You aint got to tell me why youre sick cuz I know why.  
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.  
Im an itch that they cant scratch they sick of me.  
But hey what else can I say I love LA.  
Cause over and above all its just another day  
And this one begins where the last one ends.  
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.  
Ill be dammed just fucked around and crashed my Benz.  
Driving around with a smashed front end  
Lets cash that one in.  
Grab another one from out the stable  
The Monte Carlo El Camino or the El Dorado  
The hell if I know.  
Do I want leather seats or vinyl  
Decisions decisions  
Garage looks like Precision Collision.  
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco  
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though  
  
  
  
And I take great pleasure in introducing  Cent  
  
Its bottle after bottle  
The money aint a thing when you party with me  
Its what we into its simple  
We ball out of control like you wouldnt believe  
Im the napalm the bomb the don Im King Kong  
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on  
Im so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm  
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want  
Nigga on and on till the break of what

Blow it like its supposed to be blown

Rappers try to play me they use Hailie as a ukulele  
Woopsa that a fucking daisy  
Thats a nono who even she knows Dadas fucking crazy

Maybe its because I never had a mother raise me  
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby

But its all caught up to me now karmas in the waters  
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner  
You might think it doesnt creep upon ya but it all does  
You wouldnt listen man I tried to warn ya when you started

They get so mad when I call them both fagots

Talking Obie Trice  
New shit Obie Trice   
Get familiar wit it  
  
  Obie Trice  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homies verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
Thats why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
Im so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and aint spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
    
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin its a fuckin mimick when it aint  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus Uranus  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein crazed  
You dont think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs  
  
Talking   
This is Shade   
You know how motherfuckin serious this shit is  
This shit is so motherfuckin serious


I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
Farewell miss I know that you can care less  
But Im sorry for everything I was careless  
But I need you to know that I love you so much  
And Ive been drinking myself to sleep my souls crushed  
A couple more shots I know Im gonna go nuts  
I cant deal with the fact you left me with no crutch  
I was in love with you how could you do this to me  
Actually I did this to myself what a tragedy  
And now what do I do  
Where do I go  
Cause everywhere I go I see your face  
Its hard starting over  
Trying to find another shoulder  
To lean on  
I feel like my whole life just got peed on  
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain  
As crazy as it sounds to me its sane  
And I like it why cause I feel like were still united  
In some weird way I dont wanna fight it  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
I wrote you the other day and you didnt write back  
Its like that after all the crap we been through  
I cant believe you I know I fucked up  
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up  
You keep sending me to voicemail  
Im annoyed hell shit you coulda at least sent a text  
But youre probably busy kissing someone elses lips  
While Im sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit  
Youre hard headed a sharp headache  
I need help call a medic  
I just cut myself yeah I did it  
Without you Im nothing dont you get it  
Every time that I said I loved you I meant it  
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that  
We ever met I cant believe you just said that  
Youre so cold you just hit me so low  
I cant take this no more so hit the road  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight  
  
Some things just dont seem the way they do  
 day you tell me I love you and only you  
I wake up to find out it was a dream  
Youre telling me you hate me youre leaving me  
People change everything changes  
We go from best friends then become strangers  
We go from seeing each other everyday then  
Farewell to never seeing your face again  
  
I cant get you outta of my head  
So Im out of bed at  in the morning  
Wishing I was dead  
But for some odd reason I cant do it  
For some reason I needed to write  
Whats on my mind and whats going through it  
Cause if I dont Ill probably suffocate  
Why do you have so much hate  
Towards me you need some loving babe  
God I fucking love you I hate myself  
For falling in love with you  
Just to find out all I did was trouble you  
My heart is aching Im medicated  
I tried meditating  
But nothing works I dont even feel sedated  
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second  
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked  
Fuck humiliation you do anything to get me back  
Opinions wouldnt matter what they thought in fact  
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good  
And do everything to have me if you could  
  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But sometimes things just dont go as wed like  
All I wanna do is cry  
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight

They keep on sayin the same rappers are the best  
JayZ and Kanye West maybe theyre just tryna distract it  
From the fact that Im comin back  
Or maybe its cause I aint black maybe its because of that  
Maybe its because Im the highest sellin artist in rap  
While Im sittin back in my office jackin off to my plaques  
Im still sick how can I be sick this long  
And Im still alive Magic Johnson arise  
I thrive on makin my opponents think that Ive died  
Thats when I just pop up outta nowhere oh yeah there we go there

Life  
By Marshal Mathers  
What is life  
Life is like a big obstacle  
In front of your optical to slow you down  
  
And every time you think you gotten past it  
Its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground  
What are friends  
Friends are people that you think are your friends  
But they really your enemies with secret identities  
And disguises to hide they true colors  
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers  
They want to come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin  
  
What is money  
Money is what makes a man act funny  
Money is the root of all evil  
Moneyll make them same friends come back around  
Swearing that they was always down  
  
What is life  
Im tired of life  
Im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins  
Im tired of committing so many sins  
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins  
Tired of never having any ends  
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things  
Im tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins  
Tired of not having a deal  
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel  
Tired of drowning in my sorrow  
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo  
Im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off  
Im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour  
Then this boss wonders why Im smartin off  
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough  
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk  
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk  
Im tired of using plastic silverware  
Tired of working in Building Square  
Tired of not being a millionaire  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
  
If I had a magic wand  
Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on  
While Im on the john  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough  
Because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
  
Im tired of being white trash broke and always poor  
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store  
Im tired of not having a phone  
Tired of not having a home  
To have one in if I did have it on  
Tired of not driving a BM  
Tired of not working at GM tired of wanting to be him  
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM  
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum  
Tired of not being on tour  
Tired of fucking the same blond whore  
After work in the back of a Contour  
Im tired of faking knots with a stack of ones  
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns  
  
Tired of being stared at  
Im tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat  
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz  
Tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs  
Tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me  
Saying they wasnt feeling me when nobodys as ill as me  
Im tired of radio stations telling fibs  
Tired of JLbe saying "Where HipHop Lives"  
  
But if I had a million dollars  
Id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics  
If I had a magic wand Id make the world suck my dick  
Without a condom on while Im on the john  
  
If I had a million bucks  
It wouldnt be enough because Id still be out  
Robbing armored trucks  
If I had one wish  
I would ask for a big enough ass  
For the whole world to kiss  
You know what Im saying  
Im tired of all of this bullshit  
Telling me to be positive  
Howm I sposed to be positive when I dont see shit positive  
Know what Im sayin  
I rap about shit around me shit I see  
Know what Im sayin  
Right now Im tired of everything  
Tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city  
Cant get no airplay you know what Im sayin  
But ey its cool though you know what Im sayin  
Just fed up  
Thats my word


Damn it feels good to be back  
Im having a relapse  
  
How the hell did he manage  
To get more felony charges  
Hes already got life in jail  
Man what the hell is his problem  
  
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic  
They compelled me  
To kill this elderly man  
  
And I get these panic attacks  
Pop a xanax relax  
Try to stick my fucking dick  
Inside a mannequins ass  
  
Then I get manic depressed  
And the orthodontist get gas masked  
Kick ass  
The first thing Ill put on is the mask  
  
Speaking of masks man  
It aint to late to have a change of pace  
And take it off and show my face  
So you can see the things you face  
And slice you up  
And cook you after your murder  
By strangulation  
  
thats bacon souffle  
You making aint you  
Well thank you jason  
  
There goes one more coma  
Due to blunt force trauma  
Just give me one more soma  
And Ill be done for it mama  
  
Go in the damn broom closet  
Another valium lost it  
Shovin the vacuums nozzle  
Down the bathroom faucet  
  
It seems like every day I get a little flakier  
The medication is making my hands a little shakier  
Hand me that  month old baby  
To shake him up  
Itll only take me a second to choke his trachea  
Breaking his neck in  some places  
  
Baby here shady comes lady  
Hes got the razor bablades and the chachachainsawsaw baby  
You bebeblundering bumbling mmmumbling dumm dumms  
Yeah here I come come you hear the rumbling vrum vrum  
  
theres something inside of that blue tarp  
And that drum drum  
A head and torso of someone  
Whered it come from  
  
Whos it belong to  
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair  
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms  
Clearly theres somen wrong  
Cause she didnt come home  
  
shes missing  
Where is she  
Something fishy is going on  
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs  
  
Now everybody get your dance on  
To my damn song  
Cmon


Oh yeah this is  baby  
Back up in that motherfucking ass  
 time for your mother fucking mind  
We represent the   
You know what Im saying cause they dont know shit about this  
For the   
  
Ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction  
To get your brain relaxing a zany acting maniac in action  
A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction  
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run  
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills  
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills  
Im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants  
Twist the necks of rappers til their spinal column disconnects  
We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up  
Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog  
This is the season for noise pollution contamination  
Examination of more cartoons than animation  
My lamination of narration  
Hits a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation  
When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing  
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense  
I got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse  
I greet the gents and ladies I spoil loyal fans  
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans  
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal  
 thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people  
MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium  
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one  
Imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator  
Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus  
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases  
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces  
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis  
And eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally  
With entity dementedly meant to be infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Man I got evidence Im never dense and I been clever ever since  
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO  
So Im assuming all responsibility  
Cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs  
Mic messaler slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical  
Id rather let a tactical tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I cant see or cant imagine  
A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit  
Im tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it

They said once bitten n twice shy  
We lie next to the guy  
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra  
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir  
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser  
Its my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester  
Drop kick the bits before a second trimester  
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser  
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her  
  
  
I guess its time for you to hate me again

The world is just my medicine ball your all in

The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her  
Imagine if visual for that man  
Who woulda thought  
Could ever be such a relentless prick  
And leashin his fingers  
For the chicks who waltz  
She looks like she outlived her life sentence  
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive  
If you werent so defensive it wouldnt be  
Your so sensitive

Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick  
Pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit  
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit  
Drink gin til my chins full of splashed whiskers  
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches  
Ask Bizzy hes been here the past six years  
Mash with me youll get in imagine this  
  
  
  
I fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mothers throat  
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope  
My little sisters birthday shell remember me  
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity  
And bitches know me as a hornyass freak  
Their mother wasnt raped I ate her pussy while she was sleep  
Pissydrunk throwin up in the urinal you fuckin homo  
Thats what I said at my dads funeral  
  
  
  
Thats why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still  
Thats why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed  
Thats why we dont call it Detroit we call it Amityville Ville  
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled filled  
Thats why were crowned the murder capital still still  
This aint Detroit this is motherfuckin Hamburger Hill Hill  
We dont do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot  
And when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too  
Thats the mentality here here thats the reality here here  
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh  
While Im holdin a pistol with this many calibers here here  
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year year  
Cause once I snap I cant be held accountable for my actions  
Thats when accidents happen  
When a thousand bullets come at your house  
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you  
And your family in it Ah  
God dammit he meant it when he told you  
  



Police voice  
Attention all units attention all units  
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair  
I repeat we have an APB on a man with green hair  
Hes armed with a knife I repeat hes armed with a knife  
Proceed with caution watch your back fellas  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
   
Theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
Hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm  
Hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm look for a man with green hair  
Check at your girls house he was last seen there  
Hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes  
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
We got the walkietalkies to keep us all informed  
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post  
And most of all be advised that hes wise  
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
Im on a solo mission to find him personally  
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
Its sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
Im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
"Give me your girlfriend or Im gonna kill ya"  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where Im at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume  
  
  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
   
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned  
Theyre only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone  
  
Police voice  
Attention all cars attention all cars  
Unit  has apprehended the suspect  
Hes going back to the crazy home I repeat  
Hes going back to the crazy home how about that  
  
   
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good

How could I begin  
  
Locked in Mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch  
Was red wine more red wine and Captain Crunch  
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch  
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch  
Mariah whats ever happened to us why did we have to break up  
All I asked for was a glass of punch  
You see I never really ask for much  
I cant imagine whats going through your mind after such  
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk  
Weisman Gale Nick Cannon better back the fuck up  
Im not playin I want to bag ya punk  
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk  
Mixed with Egyptian with a little rappin pump  
Zappin Eric Clapton Shaft Frank Zappa crunk  
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya  
You can beat me with any spatula thatcha want  
I mean I really want you bad you cunt  
Nick you had your fun  
Ive come to kick you in your sack of junk  
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood  
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture  
  
  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
When will it ever cease for Petes sake hes crazy to say the least  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Whats going through my mind half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause Im gone blowing on my  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad  
  
You can be a permanent fixture  
In my lyrical mixture  
Im the miracle whit trixter  
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks around  
Im bound to put on in an instant wow  
Man what an ensemble what an assortment of pharma  
Ceuticals its beautiful pill dust in my palm my  
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle  
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama  
Ill cut you like Dahmer pull a butcher knife on ya  
The size of a sword boy Im like a fucken Red Sonia  
Get it stuck in your cornea  
Nice knowin ya Norman  
Youre so fuckin annoyin  
Drop the shovel boy you dont know what the fuck ya doin  
I aint playin no fuckin more  
Nick Cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore  
Every minute theres a sucker born  
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn  
Shuck of shuck of corn shuck of corn  
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him its fucken on  
What the fuck are you doin  
Youre runnin over the snow blower  
With the lawnmower blow on your  
Bagpipes from Baghdad  
  
  
  
In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables  
I bet you they become heterosexual  
Nothing will stop me from molesting you  
Tittyfucking you til your breasticle  
Flesh tickles my testicles  
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins  
Hows it going girlfriends you need a boyfriend  
You need some ointment just make an appointment  
Whos gonna see the doctor first well do a coin flip  
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip  
When the bad get going how bad does the going get  
Baby you shouldnt have any trouble rubbing groins wit  
Each other especially when youre joined at the hip  
Im going to get the needle new thread from the sewing kit  
An attempt to seperate em and stitch em back at the loin shit  
Lured the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip  
Cookie lookie even took me a polaroid bitch  
  
  
  
Vocoder Humdelaylelahaaahhhhhhh 


Dj scratching  "Do it"  
  
  
  
Sneakin in through the back door fruity mcs get ambushed  
Rammed and squooshed slammed and pushed crammed and mushed  
Then Im movin on down from the right to left  
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death  
To get jacked attacked and cracked in two  
Smackin through til youre black and blue for actin true  
Im dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands  
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans  
Im stompin Im kickin Im chokin Im stampin em  
Clompin em stickin and pokin and clampin em  
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts  
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts  
Im zappin rappers singers and dancers  
Faster than you could snap your figures for ransom  
Cancer is in the flesh alive and breathin  
Survivin by connivin and theivin  
  
Dj scratching  "Do it" "Eat em up"  
  
  
  
I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters  
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders  
Developin a fear of biterphobia  
Im holdin a gas can and lighter over ya  
If I detect ya Ima pulverize  
Dissect your brain diggin in your skull for lies  
And Ima torture with material iller  
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer  
Im more dangerous than a loaded chamber is  
A major risk to a plagiarist  
So beware of the aura A terror for the horrible  
Will scare ya tomorrow is the airbourne assault of the rappers  
Hit the source to better my skills  
I head for the border  
And run the Galloping Hills the choice is yours  
Cause now buddys noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse  
Cause Im sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage
yours to bite like labradors  
In the range of my doublebarrel  
And your life is in danger trouble and peril  
  
Dj scratching  
  
  
  
I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires  
Cuz vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers  
And swing on my big thingamajig  
So Im bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig  
Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that Ive said over reels  
Thats how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So Im forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and its ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative  
Pronouns and verbs predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya  times outta   
Thats why Im spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen  
  
Dj scratching  "Everybody walk out the back door"  
  
Dj scratching to fade


Yo check it out its fucked up and I dont see either one of us budging  
  
Im withholding my anger  
Though Id like to be the strangler  
Of this punk ass little pussys puny neck  
Its my right to insist  
That he acknowledge my existence  
But he just displays complete lack of respect  
Thats what he says to himself  
As he uses magazines to trash me  
As he sits with both feet up at his desk  
Smokes a bag of his weed  
And starts imagining things  
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed  
And in his jealousy and envy  
It just whirls him in a frenzy  
As he turns on MTV and sees my face  
He dont exist in this world  
So he just twists and he twirls  
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a rage  
And its destroying him slowly  
Cause he does not even know me  
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes  
So he just tortures himself  
He has no fortune and wealth  
So he extorts someone else to get his dough  
And now hes acting like a bully  
So he tries to push and pull me  
But he knows that he cant pull me so hes mad  
He has no choice but to scream  
And raise his voice up at me  
Cause it annoys him to see that I aint scared  
  
You aint no motherfucking bully  
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking bully  
I wont allow it aint no coward to no bully  
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully  
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully  
  
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally  
  
Now Im not trying to make no more enemies  
No more unfortunately  
Theres so many motherfuckers that just are  
They just keep pounding at me  
Now that Im down with   
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja laughter  
But his ass is such a puppet  
Irv could shove his whole hand up it  
And just make him say what he wants him to say  
But Suge has Irvs on a string  
And Irvs so nervous that he  
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay  
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough  
And Murder Inc.s the big bad wolf  
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down  
But our buildings made out of bricks  
So you aint taking out shit  
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown  
So now you try to pull a race card  
And it backfires in your face hard  
cause you know we dont play that black and white shit  
Plus this guy that you fucked  
When you was ecstasied up  
Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch  
  
You must be taking to much E  
  
Now what bothers me the most  
About hiphop is we so close  
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac  
We just lost Jam Master J  
Big L got blasted away  
Plus we lost Bugs Slayed Son and Freaky Ta  
Its like a neverending cycle  
That just seems to come full circle  
Everyones gotta be so fucking hard  
Im not excluding myself  
cause I been stupid as well  
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart  
But as we grow as men  
We learn to let shit go but then again  
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand  
We all got reps to uphold  
When someone steps on our toes  
Its no exception it goes for every man  
But if Irv really gave a fuck  
About Ja like he claims he does  
Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs  
But he just keeps feeding him pills  
So if that E doesnt kill him  
Someone from GUnit will and I aint buzzed  
Dawg Im talking to you straight  
If the situation escalates  
Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game  
And if I get killed for this rap  
I got a million in cash  
That says I will get you back in Halies name  
  
Irvine get your boy off that E  
  
Get at me dawg  
Holla


Scratched sample  "Im the man"  
  
I stand in by the way as I begin  
Do you know who I am and may reply with a grin  
Yes Im tired of being  
Why should I be secluded I got a brand new horn to be tooted  
To sum it up in a nutshell " will you kick it for me"  
So I find myself in a certaindepligatory  
A place where I dwell in for some wonderful productions  
To make up for lost time  
Finally let loose unloading the stockpile  
A mental projectile I aim like a reptile  
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this  
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus"  
Is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating  
How many times will it take you before you realize youre fading  
Fading from existence cause simulations are dead  
Theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read  
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor  
While I hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor  
Words can weigh a ton  
Therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  
  
Scratched samples  "Yeah" "Its another  
  
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side  
But I see no borderline from under this colorblind  
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred  
But then Im finally about to put an end to the hatred  
The world would never endure to arguing  
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling  
"Oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do  
You cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to"  
The outcome we want nothing despicable  
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable  
Youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and  
Youre dull its time you faced this here taste this  
Straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles  
The date of my birth on the Earth the deliverence of a starchild  
Rest with formidable talent and versatility  
  
But with such a power there comes a responsibilty  
To infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear  
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear  
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin  
Refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend  
  
Scratched samples  "Yeah" "Its another"  
  
You know I dont understand why we all just cant get along  
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for  
No so then why do you speak for me  
And every other white man when you that were your enemy  
  
On the floor lies a broken door cause Im not to be spoken for  
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore  
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me  
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry  
But Ive apologies are exhausted  
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted  
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted  
Switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted  
Pull up the quick  
These we hate him these are past us huh  
Always fighting for the position of top dog  
That spots already occupied and I dont play leapfrog  
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine  
But Im always having to proove myself time after time  
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast  
Judged from the past and hes put last  
And bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin  
And mutterin words with no meaning attack me side Im like Danny Kane  
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin  
And eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please  
Ive got a craving  
  
Scratched sample until end  "Im the man"


Tell myself that I was doin all right  
Theres nothin left to do tonight  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
Cant you see what you do to me baby  
You make me crazy you make me act like a maniac  
Im like a lunatic you make me sick  
Youre truly the only one who can do this to me  
You just make me get so crazy  
I go schizo I get so insane I just go schizophrenic  
 minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex  
You make me crazy  
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack  
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe thats a bad habit  
Cause the next day we right back at it  
In the same exact pattern  
What the fuck is the matter with us  
We cant figure out if its lust  
Or its love which that is attractin us to each other  
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  
Which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch  
But I stay and still stick it out with you  
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it  
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you  
Just cause I came home late last night  
Crawled in bed and I woke you  
But if theres one thing about you that I admire  
Its baby because you stay with me  
Maybe cause youre as crazy as I am  
Cause when I look at you  
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside  
I see a freakish little side like a devil in disguise  
Youre always full of surprises  
Always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildos  
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  
Youre only twenty four but youre plenty more mature  
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  
Like theyre in middle school still youre crazy sexy cool  
Chill you play your position you never step out of line  
Even though I stay in your business  
Youve always kept out of mine  
I wonder whats on your mind  
Sometimes they say love is blind  
Maybe thats why the first time I dotted your eye  
You didnt see the sign  
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  
Maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy crazy on you oh  
You are the ink to my paper  
What my pen is to my my pad  
The moral the very fiber  
The whole substance to my rap  
You are my reason for being  
The meaning of my existence  
If it wasnt for you I would never be able to spit this  
As intense as I do and the irony  
Is you rely on me as much  
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do  
You provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  
Youre my entire supply of gas the match and igniter  
The only way that Im able to stay so stable  
Is youre the legs to my table  
If you were to break Id fall on my face  
But Im always gonna make you feel  
I dont need you as much as I really need you  
So you dont use it to your advantage  
But youre essential to me  
Youre the air I breathe  
I believe if you ever leave me  
Id probably have no reason to be  
You are the Kim to my   
Youre the Slim to my Shady  
The Dre to my   
The Alana to my Hailie  
You are the word that Im lookin for  
When Im tryin to describe how I feel inside  
And the right one just wont come to my mind  
Youre like the pillar that props me up  
The beam that supports me  
The bitch who never took half  
The wife who never divorced me  
Youre like the root to my evil  
You let my devil come out me  
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  
And no matter how much too much is never enough  
Maybe cause were crazy in love  
  
Let me go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go Crazy crazy on you oh


You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
Its funny how Ive got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I aint got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
 day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look whos laughing  
Im sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart  
Jme on my chain  
Money on my head  
So it stays on my brain  
Till it turns me insane  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
But I dont wanna spend my whole life sleeping in bed  
Im tryna make a dream come to life  
Ill sleep when Im dead  
Time to get down  
Tie my lace up  
Cos Im about to chase some paper  
And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when Im all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
Im talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now its a brand new day  
And Ill be doin it again  
Its time for the main attraction  
  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life dont ask you if youre ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream


Fuck an intro man lets go  
I come around like what goes around.  
What goes up must come down.  
Anyone who comes up must go down.  
Might as well go for the gusto now.

Last shot give it all you got.  
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob  
Fuck all you snobs.  
Hoes I hope all you rot.

And you wanna manage a trois you twots

Get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall.  
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum yall aint nothtin but a whole lot of suckin
goin on in rap.  
Yeah but Im home.  
Bad to the bone back in the zone  
Let him alone  
You dont wanna go eggin him on.  
  
Itll never be my chair that youre on.  
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen.  
Otherwords theres no heir to the throne.  
When I die so does hip hop.  
Hitchcock better shit bitch ass gotgot a zip locked in a bag.  
You fags aint been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.  
Keep blogging while Im mind boggling my zone like Im in the twilight dog
get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.  
  
Flow so wet Ima take this beat tobogganin.  
Im water logging it Im sogging it.  
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.  
Suplexin it on cement like Im on some straight outta compton shit  
Take this dick and chomp on it.  
Im so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment.  
Jackass eat a donkey dick.  
The game I just about conquered it like Donkey Kong  
Im bonkers bitch Im the king of this honkey shit I reign supreme in this
honkey shit.  
No sense screaming and arguing.  
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.  
You think you ball well I palm it.  
I throw up bombs when I vomit.  
Boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelet.  
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.  
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.  
Bitch Im as bat shit as Ozzy its obvious you can tell I go right off the
bat.  
No pun intended but come any closer Ill bite off your head.  
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web Im just gonna
spin it and try to use it to my advantage.  
I catch a fly in that bitch.  
You think you fly you just food.  
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude.  
Guess I just do what you cant do or make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too  
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck outta hells
kitchen  
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken.  
Yeah its Shady slut the rest can suck on a big one.  
Cause Im despicable as daffy duck when Im spitting.  
Haha recovery


  
Oh all around the World  
Theres an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
  
Royce  
Classical palms  
Battle my own demons  
I need a glass of Patron  
Bad as I need a horn  
Stabbing my clavicle bone  
Im at it or prone  
First time I seen a dessert eagle  
I was letting the  buss  
The  pop  
First time you seen one you was eating coco puffs  
Looking at Robocop  
Im not a man Im a logo Im sustain  
In order to clean my things you need saline  
Im never refering to the solution  
Im talking about more like the mustang  
Vroom  
Get respect from the getgo hello  
Set to the echo pyscho  
Pen got a mind of its own gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise  
Ill probably vibe out to a nine minute song  
As the echo follows the Maserati  
As the petrol swallows  
Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton  
Check your bible inside it it will say this guys an elephant  
Im fly like Im killing the scene like Im a villain with wings  
Ill sleep when Im  feet deep  
Right now Im living a dream  
Though we may be reckless  
The ladies check us  
They whisper Shady records  
Baby echo  
  
  
Oh all around the World  
Theres an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
They will follow the echo echo echo echo  
  
  
I can hear them calling calling calling calling calling  
I eat rappers with the rhyme consume em  
The only fcking thing that you consume is time

Its too complex girl you assuming cupids looming  
My mentalitys caveman stupid woman  
My life is Truman show all I have is music hoe  
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago  
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow  
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think Imma lay here just spooning yo  
Oh you think you the shit cause I just said you was beautiful  
Diabolical till the last molecule down to my last hair folicle and cuticle  
Rhyming to the call to the  all the way down to my sock and the hair on my
toe  
Learn how to sew so shut my own booty hole  
Cause I aint took no sht since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first
pubic grow  
I told these stupid hoes when I come back Imma set this bitch on fire  
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her  
Cause this time muthafckers Im put my whole Goddamn dick inside her  
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet  
Ima go get tip and try to rip it wider  
  
  
Oh all around the World

And they all know all the girls the boys  
They chase the noise

Hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking

Ive been kickin ass off bullshit  
Throwaway rhymes pick a batch  
I live for the love of rap you crazy  
Ive made beats for JayZ for free  
Page me you need a beat you Cannabis  
Then its Dres fee you Kay Slay the fees waved  
I stay beefin with jd till the day Dre ways me  
That its okay to stop blazin him  
Oops I put it out I apologize now  
Its too late G its on tape  
And the tape leaped "Say What You Say" mothafucka  
Drama King Kay Slay mothafucka We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka  
zibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka


Met a retarted kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg  
Go to bed with a keg wake up with a forty  
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula D  
Forget an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas  
Cross the bombest  
We blowing up your house  
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas  
Im as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today yesterday  
And the day before Sabateur  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure


Lord please forgive for what I do  
For I know not what Ive done.  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
head popped off  
But mama dont want me the next thing I know Im gettin dropped off  
getting dropped off

getting dropped off  
Ring ring ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front
porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
Their front porch  
But they didnt want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Elses lawn  
Til someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
Edna and Charles  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary theyd gang up on me and sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
Sing this song  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just dont understand understand  
And by the way wheres my dad  
  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mothers evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately predominately everythings always predominately  
Predominatelywhite predominatelyblack well what about me  
Where does that leave me  
Well I guess that Im between predominately both of em  
I think if I hear that fuckin word again Im a scream  
While Im projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you  
Do you think that Im kidding  
What do I look like some kinda idiot  
Wait a minute shit dont answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
Its such Bullshit its tush mull bish  
Woe is me there goes poor  again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow hes always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his exwife how they go at it man  
Id hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it I cant imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it  
Shit if you only knew the half of it  
  
  
  
Evil deeds while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I dont wanna be Satans spawn never got the chance to say Im sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear SantaClause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this  
Everything could have been So perfect but life aint a fairy tale.  
Im about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me theres people everywhere  
I dont even know but who feel like they know me cause Im in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merrygoround  
Here we go now dosido now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ringaroundtherosie the shows over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just dont close for me  
This aint how fame was supposed to be  
Wheres the switch I can just turn offandon this aint what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
Til I pass  back the baton the cameras on my soul is gone  
  
  
  
Ooh  
Last one baby  
Lets Go  
Detroit


Risin up back on the street  
Did my time took my chances  
Went the distance now Im back on my feet

Dont lose your grip on the dreams of the past

Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor

In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above  
I want this hand in its rightful glove  
Have people saying god damn shes fine  
Me responding with damn right shes mine  
Even though your gone I try and carry on  
Its sad but its true me and you  
Were through  
But people still think they know us and they dont know shit  
But I want you to know Im sorry and I still love you britt  
But now Ive come to see our destiny will never fit  
And thats why now I look back being once lost then found  
Its getting tougher with you not around  
Your the only thing that got me to smile  
I guess our love was a truthful denile  
Sometimes I remenice at what we had  
Not knowin I was causing my baby to be sad  
I never once tried to cause you this pain  
Its crazy how one person can make you go insane  
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times  
We fought yea but people act like its a fuckin crime  
No couples perfect everyone faces bullshit  
All I ever tried was to show you I loved you britt  
But its sad cause the image I portray the pieces dont fit  
All this time how could it be my destiny will never be you and me  
But I wish people could see how much Im so crazy  
In love with you its true I wish it was still me and you  
Doin what we use to do I wish they really knew  
And I wish theyd know Id never let anything bad happend to you  
I got your back to the fullest baby nems one to stay truest  
But times were tough and shit got rough  
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought  
But just know britt my rhymes are true  
Britt please know Ill forever Love you  
It just sucks cause theres a few out there that got Nems back  
People always tellin me get your fuckin life on track  
But in order to do that I need you back  
And thats why you dont know what you got till its gone  
Im so sorry that our love was always off and on.

Here it go  
See this is the part I was worried about  
Everybody thinks that my career was down the tubes  
And I must be in some dusty garage  
Inhalin the carbon monoxide fumes  
And everyones tellin me what I should do and how I should come out or what
to rap about  
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out  
And Im not sure how this is gonna come off  
Theyre probably gonna think that Im comin off as cocky  
Like I just started givin a fuck what you really think about me worship  
See the thing about me is you dont really know a thing about me  
Everyones makin a stink about me  
Like its some kind of a aura of that up that came around me  
Surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers


What would it take to push a man  
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life  
What would drive someone completely over the edge  
To do some shit like that the green and gold.  
  
I done filled my lungs up  
With so much of this crack smoke  
My necks bloated my techs loaded  
Im flat broke and Im pissed off  
Mad at the world Ive had it with girls  
And Im frustrated ran to the bus stop  
Just made it and hopped on  
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on  
I spot JOHN a white collar worker  
In clean cut walked up to em  
He was like what whatchu mean what you know what time it is man  
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.  
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen  
A man holdin a nine and then  
Shot him from the bottom up  
Stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck  
Hopped out to flee on my feet  
Fucked around forgot that I left my ID on the seat

And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress  
Coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh  
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis  
Im so bananas Im showin up to your open casket  
To fill it full of explosive gasses

Blow you to fragments

Repeat x

But if were hellbound whatever lets go down  
  
JBlack

Leave the E.R. then hit a bar for a liquor shot til the liver spot  
 day we all gon die  
But when I die Ima be so high  
That Ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare  
With the chalk outline still there  
I smoke til I choke and I sex a lot  
I got a cross on my chain but its just a rock  
Now if I pray every night night  
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight  
You feel me God I done did so much shit while on Earth  
I smoke I drink I curse and to make matters worse  
I bust my gun first and then I chat with your corpse  
Since way back I was one to never like backtalk  
See me at the pearly gates in line wearin a Nordface  
Nickel nine at my waist God done lost faith  
Angels greet me but I dont reply back  
Just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres Thai at  
  
  
  
Masta Ace  
Analyze the strength of my game like Lee Corso  
Call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso  
And of course yo yall know Im no stranger to danger  
Like Christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger  
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound  
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds  
My pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger  
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her  
Ten blocks untie the bitch and I still bag her  
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager  
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel  
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel  
Everyday I grow more older and more colder  
Fly you to Colorado roll you over with a Boulder  
I know you want to retaliate but you wont dare  
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care  
  
Repeat x  
  
But every time I take a step it gets dim tell me is this hell were livin in

Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin go crack

Wrap me in a bolt of lightning  
Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe thats the way I should go  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought Id be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way  
  
  
  
I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
Im writing to you cuz Im hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents dont care that I do this shit  
No one loves me its like  
Im a piece of trash  
I dont get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you dont reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way  
  
  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason dont you forget that  
Pulled whats the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
Its just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all its doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead whats the point in all this  
  
I finally put it all together  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe thats the way it should be  
You know Ive led my life like a gypsy  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say. So Ill be on my way

Check it out  
  
Hey Kyu  
  
  
Its a broke day but everything is OK Its OK  
Im up all night but everything is alright Its alright  
Its a rough week and I dont get enough sleep I cant sleep  
Its a long year pretending I belong here Belong here  
  
 day I plan to be a family man happily married  
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried  
Til Im glad to be buried  
And leave this crazy world  
  
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl  
It may be early to be planning this stuff  
Cause Im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough  
Cause man its been rough but still I manage enough  
  
Ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed  
My hands have been cuffed  
But I dont panic and huff frantic and puff  
Or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts  
  
Im anteing up double or nothing Ive been trouble enough  
And Im sick of struggling and suffering see  
My destinys to rest at ease till Im impressed and pleased  
With my progress I wont settle for less than cheese  
  
Im on a quest to seize all my own label to call  
Way before my baby is able to crawl  
Im too stable to fall the pressure motivates  
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades  
  
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth  
Where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf Kyu  
  
  
  
Im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps  
Everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep  
Praying for sleep  
Dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
In this slaughtering house caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
Ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grants and Jacksons  
These transactions explain a mans actions  
But in the mist of this insanity I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and theres a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brothers trying to learn his mathematics  
Hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
Im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
Its cumbersome Im trying to do well on this Earth  
But its been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth  
  
  
  
Uh its OK yeah its alright even though I cant sleep  
Uh yeah its OK its alright I cant sleep

Look  
If you had  
 shot  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy  
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti  
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin  
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out  
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now  
The clocks run out times up over blaow  
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity  
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked  
Hes so mad but he wont give up that easy No  
He wont have it he knows his whole back citys ropes  
It dont matter hes dope he knows that but hes broke  
Hes so stacked that he knows when he goes back to his mobile home thats
when its  
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him  
  
  
You better lose yourself in the music the moment  
You own it you better never let it go  
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king as we move toward a new world order  
A normal life is borin but super stardoms close to post mortar  
It only grows harder only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose its old partna but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
  
  
No more games Im a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cipher  
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to  
 and I cant provide the right type of  
Life for my family cause man these God damn food stamps dont buy diapers  
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And its getting even harder tryin to feed and water my seed plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a primadonna  
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not  
Mom I love you but this trail has got to go I cannot grow old in Salems
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got  
  
  
  
You can do anything you set your mind to man


A distant alarm a sound from far away  
We raised our heads towards the sky but there was nothing there to see  
The restless crowd is now breaking the silence  
Anxiety is rising the sky is turning dark  
A riot is emerging men beat men to death  
This is unexplainable a fight without a battle  
The alarm resounds and someone called in a speaker  
"This is not a drill I repeat this is not a drill"  
  
Today we die today we testify  
All we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
Reversed evolving turning people into beasts  
Theyre feasting on eachother strong consume the weak  
Flaming ruins society is lost  
Shattered city streets filled with blind nameless creatures  
The sky cracks open dust is descending  
Breath the black air feel darkness in your lungs  
Silence  nothing makes a sound  
But we can still hear the sound of the alarm  
  
Today we die today we testify  
All we do must come to an end  this is the end  
  
A distant early warning  
A sound from far away  
We raised our heads  
Towards the sky  
Towards the alarm


Obie Trice  
You dont see me in the hood its cause Im doing this man  
  
Niggas Im still grinding yeah I still hearing those sirens  
Im still getting chased by those lights  
Only the lights lime and my mics on  
And my time is none because Im writing more  
I dont hear to meet a soul in this business

I aint gonna let you derail me man  
I got Young Kobe homey you gotta let go of Obie  
Cause Obie be back going nowhere man we got them craps going on  
And that yak going on soon as a nigga touch down back from town

Right we want to love alcohol we want to love guns we want to love money  
we dont love no bitches though  
I just want to love for the rest of my life  
I want to hold you in the morn hold you in the night  
  
  
Theres a certain mystique when I speak that you notice  
Cause its sort of unique cause you know its me  
My poetrys deep and Im stillmatic the way I flow to this beat  
You cant sit still its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep  
Im strapped its known any minute I could snap  
Im the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped  
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically  
It aint even funny I aint even hungry it aint even money  
You cant pay me enough for you to play me  
Its cockamamie you just aint zany enough to rock with Shady  
My noodle is cockadoodle my clocks coocoo  
I got screws loose yea the whole kit and caboodle Im just brutal  
Its no rumor Im numero uno assume it theres no more humor in it you

Im rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag  
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass you better love me bitch  
  
  
  
 Cent

If it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain  
If I was you Id love men too I roll like a boss  
 eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce  
I aint gon front I thought R. Kelly was the shit  
Let me find out he fucking round with Bow Wow bitch  
Niggas eating popcorn right rewinding the tape  
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape  
Im convinced man something really wrong with these hos  
I thought Lil Kim was hot til she start fucking with her nose  
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill and tap my feet  
Then the bitch put out a CD and didnt have no beats  
That nigga DAngelo he determined not to fail  
That nigga went buttass for his record to sell  
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes  
And Big Ben taught Charlie B More to deep throat yea  
  
  
  
 Cent  
I love the burners the money the bunnies I just want to hold you ha ha  
I just want to love you yea


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
I cant tell you what it really is  
I can only tell you what it feels like  
And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe  
I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight  
As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight  
High off of love drunk from my hate  
Its like Im huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer  
I suffocate and right before Im about to drown  
She resuscitates me she fucking hates me  
And I love it wait  
Where you going Im leaving you  
No you aint come back  
Were running right back here we go again  
Its so insane cause when its going good its going great  
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane  
But when its bad its awful  
I feel so ashamed I snapped whos that dude  
I dont even know his name I laid hands on her  
Ill never stoop so low again I guess I dont know my own strength  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
You ever love somebody so much  
You can barely breathe when youre with them you meet  
And neither one of you even know what hit em  
Got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get em  
Now youre getting fucking sick of looking at em  
You swore youve never hit em never do nothing to hurt em  
Now youre in each others face  
Spewing venom and these words when you spit em  
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em  
Throw em down pin em so lost in the moments when youre in em  
Its the rage thats the culprit it controls you both  
So they say its best to go your separate ways  
Guess that they dont know ya cause today that was yesterday  
Yesterday is over its a different day  
Sound like broken records playin over but you promised her  
Next time youll show restraint  
You dont get another chance  
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again  
Now you get to watch her leave  
Out the window guess thats why they call it window pane  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
  
Now I know we said things did things  
That we didnt mean and we fall back into the same patterns  
Same routine but your tempers just as bad as mine is  
Youre the same as me but when it comes to love youre just as blinded  
Baby please come back it wasnt you  
Baby it was me maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems  
Maybe thats what happens When a tornado meets a volcano  
All I know is I love you too much to walk away now  
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk  
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk  
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball  
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the dry wall  
Next time there will be no next time  
I apologize even though I know its lies  
Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar  
If she ever tries to fucking leave again  
Im a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But thats alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie


Maxine  
  
Hello  
Can I speak to Maxine  
Yeah this is me whats up  
What up  
  
Who dis  
Denaun  
Yeah whats up  
What are you doing  
  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Huh  
Nothing just laying in bed  
Why  
  
I dont know thinking about something freaky to do  
  
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine  
She tests positive but tells you that her acts clean  
Plus she got a sugar daddy  
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly  
  
If you mistook her sadly on her reputation  
Youre in jepordation if you aint got no preparation  
When you step away son she got her face done  
Looking provocative shell let you knock it if  
  
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you  
If you match the price otherwise she wont look at you twice  
But when you catch the lice or get the urgency  
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee  
  
Dont bring your germs to me cause I aint trying to hear it  
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it Maxine  
  
Sometimes I wonder whats your purpose In life that is  
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit  
You living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night  
You say its gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down  
  
And then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this  
Mystery whatever your reason even is to be  
You say you want to be with me but how can you say that  
When you got niggas hiding in your closet  
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely  
  
I met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me  
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies  
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas  
Big game over there and take notes while I get this number  
  
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..  
Havent I seen you before" looked at my nigga  
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands  
And said "Oh its like that"  
  
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit  
She started crying and asked me to forgive her and shit  
She said her name was Maxine so I told her I wanted her number  
She asked could I give her mine too  
  
Got to the crib and called her up  
We got into a good conversation thats when she asked me could I fuck  
I said "Maxine check this out  
Give me your address Ill be through and youll find out"  
  
Got to the crib she let me in  
She didnt waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom  
I said "Hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things.  
What the fuck are you doing"  
  
So I went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing  
As she went for my midsection  
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt  
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work  
  
Before I hit it she said  
" dont get mad but theres something that I gotta tell your ass"  
I said "What is it another nigga Its ok"  
She said "No I forgot to tell you that I got AIDS"  
I got up out  
  
Hey Maxine  
What  
You thinking about sucking my dick  
Yeah for a small price  
  
For a small price What you mean  
You know money nigga  
You dont need no damn money  
I cant give you no money anyways I heard you got some shit.  
  
What you what you hear I got

Oh for real its like that

Tweedledetweedledumb  
  
It doesnt take much  
For me to raise such a stink up  
When motherfuckers hate your guts  
You aint even gotta say much  
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers  
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush  
I cant explain what it is my brain does  
But however it works its insane  
Its plain nutz  
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous  
Its a whole combination of things  
It takes nutz  
And Im not affriad to raise the stakes up  
I got a million bucks in the banks and  trucks  
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us  
Im patiently waiting for the day  
Im anxious  
To see the look on ya fake mugs  
When you thugs go bankrupt  
Ya drunk  
Ya aint tough  
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas  
This is me talking motherfucker  
This aint drugs  
You wanna pop shit wakeup then makeup  
FUCK THAT  
Its too late chump now face up  
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and  musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause Ive always came off  
Like jas chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I dont stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I dont gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause Ive been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just aint ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since  mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls  
Trust me  
  
Monkey see monkey do  
Dont ever make the first move  
Just let em come to you  
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do  
So let em come to you  
The rest of us follow suit

Huh

Haha  
Yo we out

"All I see is blood and murder my mind state"  
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate"  
"All I see is blood and murder my mind state"  
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill  
  
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands heres yo life span  
And for what yo lifes worth this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
Im thirsty for this green so bad Im dehydratin  
Hurry up with the cash bitch I got a ride waitin  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin  
I want the whole pie I wont be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars aint enough to water the seed the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasnt nothin for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"  
But Im already wanted for sellin Kis  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest  
  
  
  
Left the house pullin out the drive backin out  
We were backin out this ladys Jag started blackin out  
Pulled the Mac out stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin mouth  
fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair smacked her up  
Thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up  
Stole her car made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on "Set it Off" did  
Jetted off kid stole the whip now Im a criminal  
Drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but Im injured badly though  
Parents screamin "Son go in and call the police  
Tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eightyyear old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese eggs milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up Im surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin "truce truce"  
Dont shoot Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasnt me  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps  
  



Yo yeah girl  
Can you hear that Its playing our song  
Are you sleepy Take a nap  
Youre not afraid of the dark Are you  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakotas door its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back with binoculars not cause I wanna peep  
But because Im hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums oh look here comes  hes on your street  
Hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on em hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am  
  
  
My music box  
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box  
But I can hear you my love you keep calling me My music box  
And when were worlds apart you mean the world to me My music box  
If you call Ill come I will answer My music box  
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box  
I hear my music box playing a song for me My music box  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box  
Wont you be my private little dancer My music box  
  
I almost look comatose who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mothers make up get naked and run around  
Wavin the gun around I think Im down to a hundred pounds  
Theres thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out  
I must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about  
Voices are leading me up to the attic I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest but what do I do its locked  
I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full I smell a funeral guess Ill loom in the park  
  
  
  
Im fixated on asphyxiating and breakin this little chicks  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin bitches get horsewhippins  
Im in the back through the back door slip in  
Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin  
The mortician of love sent from above  
Forced and treat em all  stingy Ive become  
Been doin this for more than a quarter century Im just numb  
Am I dreamin is it real Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder  
Id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that Ill have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments backtoback like Tabatha  
Im your secret admirer Im back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin her  
Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera  
Stand back cause here comes your man Jack so Pamela  
  



Yea oh oh yea yea oh  
  
I feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing  
  
I smell something in the air thats making me high  
I said I smell something in the air thats making me high  
  
Ok here we go doremifaso Im so ladida so  
Lyrical rise flow give back the tobasco  
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs  
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos  
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole  
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto  
Knives strangling wives with pig lasso  
Few bags of the the grass zig zags Im with the doc so  
You know how that go skull and the crossbones  
This is poison the boys and girls who do not know  
You do not want to try this at home my novato novice  
This is niether the time or the place to get macho  
So crack a six pack sit back with some nachos  
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow  
Its not what you expected tho what you thought though  
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke  
  
  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers gotten into me I dont mind  
  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers got into me I dont mind  
  
Your dreams of getting the pill you are literally getting the chills  
Spitting at will me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill  
Youre submitting to skill sitting still Im admitting Im beginning to
feel  
Like I dont think anyones real  
Faced with a dilemma I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please dont upset me mama you lookin sexy mama  
Dont know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Dont want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped  
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in  
And how they attacked the victim  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one  
Which night it was done what kid would write there was none  
So sloppy like this its fun the fuckin ecstasy goes  
  
  
  
When Im behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that youre trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre legends are made this way  
Isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some  
He can give her some she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
Youre spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance Im  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain thats full of surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening this aint even a weed thing  
I aint even smoke anything I aint even drink anything  
  



Daddy what are you doing  
Okay then  
Everybody listen up  
Im goin to hell  
Whos comin with me  
Somebody please help him  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Theres no mountain I cant climb theres no tower too high  
No plane that I cant learn how to fly  
What do I gotta do to get through to you  
To show you there aint nothin I cant take this chainsaw to  
Fuckin brains brawn and brass balls I cutem off  
And gotem pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall  
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton Johns name on my drag wall  
Im out the closet Ive been lyin my ass off  
All this time me and Dre been fuckin with hats off Suck it .  
So tell Laura and her husband to back off  
Before I push this motherfuckin button and blast off  
And launch one at these Russians and thats all  
Blow every fuckin thing except Afghanistan on the map off.  
When will it stop When will I knock the crap off  
Hailie tell em baby  
My Dads Lost It  
  
  
Theres really nothin else to say I I cant explain it  
I think my dads gone crazy  
A little help from Hailie Jade wont you tell em baby  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me  
I think my dads gone crazy  
Theres no one on earth that can save me not even Hailie  
I think my dads gone crazy  
  
Its like my mother always told me and codeine and  
Goddammit you little motherfucker  
If you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin  
Uh fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin dick  
Chew on a prick and lick  
A million mutherfuckin cocks per second  
Id rather put out a mutherfuckin Gospel record  
Id rather be a pussy whipped bitch eat pussy  
And have pussy lips glued to my face  
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin my flows  
Quit givin me my ammo. Cant you see why Im so mean  
If yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my M.O.  
I wouldnt have to go eenee meenee meini mo  
Catch a homo by his toe man I dont know no more  
Am I the only fuckin one whos normal any more  
Dad  
  
  
  
My songs can make you cry take you by surprise at the same time  
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme  
See what youre seein is a genius at work which to me isnt work  
So its easy to misinterpret it at first  
Cause when I speak its tongueincheek  
Id yank my fuckin teeth before Id ever bite my tongue  
Id slice my gums get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once  
And die and come back as Vanilla Ices son  
And walk around the rest of my life spit on  
And kicked and hit with shit every time  
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on.  
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl  
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade standin on Ronnies grave  
Screamin at the sky til clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade  
And thats pretty much the gist of it the parents are pissed but the kids
love it.  
 millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers  
I dont blame you I wouldnt let Hailie listen to me neither  
  
  
  
Crazy

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl  
I never meant to bring you to my world  
Now you sitting in the corner crying  
And now its my fault My fault  
  
I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave  
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved  
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up  
With first aid tape and raped on the first date  
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using  
She loved booze and alternative music  
Told me she was going back to using again  
I said wait first try this hallucinogen  
Its better then heroin and booze and gin  
Come here lets go in here  
Whos in the den Its me and Kelly  
My bad lets try another room I dont trust you  
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom  
This will help you get in touch with your roots  
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods  
Oh hell I might as well try them this party is so drag  
Oh dag I didnt mean for you to eat the whole bag Uh  
  
  
  
Yo Sue Get away from me I dont know you  
Oh shoot shes tripping I need to go puke  
I wasnt trying to turn this into something major  
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature  
Susie stop crying I dont hate ya  
The world is not against you  
I am sorry your father raped you  
So you had your little coochie in your dads mouth  
That aint no reason to start wiggin and spaz out  
She said Help me I think I am having a seizure  
I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my tshirt Let go  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me  
She said I am  years old and I am not married I dont even have any  
Kids and I cant cook  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
Cause I never seen one eat as many shrooms as you ate  
  
  
  
Susie where you going you better be careful  
leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John wheres Dave at before I bash you  
Hes in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
Theres a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And theres only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off  
Well it depends on how may youve had  
I took  she had the other  caps  
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol She is going to die dude  
I know and its my fault My god  
  
  
  
I am so sorry I am so sorry  
Susie please wake up  
What are you doing  
Your not dead
