# Rap Lyrics Generator
This project aims to generate rap lyrics by using a deep neural network with LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) units. This problem is interesting because it is not only necessary to generate coherent lyrics, but also to create lyrics that rhyme. This requires the model to output a word that is similar grammatically and/or phonetically to a previous word the occurred T words previously, where T could be as low as 1 or could be much larger depending on the beat or style of the artist.
